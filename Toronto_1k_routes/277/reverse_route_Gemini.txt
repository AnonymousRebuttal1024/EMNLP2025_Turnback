The presence of street names like Shangarry Drive and Biscayne Boulevard, the recreational trail name (Gatineau Corridor Recreation Trail), and the "sharp left" turn provide specific landmarks and increase confidence in the reversal. This area, based on the names, appears residential and likely includes parks or green spaces associated with the recreational trail.  This is in the Don Valley North area near the intersection of Finch Ave East and Victoria Park Ave.
