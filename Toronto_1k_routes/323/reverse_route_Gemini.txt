Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the Briar Hill-Belgravia neighbourhood, north of St. Clair Avenue West. Locksley Avenue, Roselawn Avenue, the West Belt Line Trail, and Briar Hill Avenue are all located in this area, providing strong anchor points.  The presence of the trail and the relatively short distances, along with the specific street names, make me fairly confident in the reverse route.  Potential POIs include the Nordheimer Ravine and residential properties. The detailed street names and relatively short, contained route improve confidence.
