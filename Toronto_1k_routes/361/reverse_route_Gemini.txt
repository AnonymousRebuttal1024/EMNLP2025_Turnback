Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the Yonge and Eglinton/Lawrence Park area.  Castlewood Road is a helpful marker. The long straight segments suggest following major roads, possibly Yonge Street or Mount Pleasant Road. The turns likely represent smaller connecting streets.  Potential POIs could include residential areas, shops and restaurants along Yonge Street, and possibly parks like Blythwood Ravine Park.  I've decreased confidence slightly due to the lack of street names for most of the route, making precise turns ambiguous.
