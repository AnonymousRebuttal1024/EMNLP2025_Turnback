Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route is relatively straightforward, with mostly long stretches and few turns.  Reversing is easy. The mention of "Albert Avenue" helps to ground it geographically, likely in a less densely developed area of Toronto. However, the lack of additional landmarks and the "keep right/left" instructions introduce some minor uncertainty about the precise path.  The long straight stretches make the overall directional accuracy fairly certain, though.
