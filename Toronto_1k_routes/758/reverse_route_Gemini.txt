Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route is in the east end, likely near the intersection of St. Clair East and Warden Avenue, with St. Clair Avenue East, Sandra Road, Woodmount Avenue, and Virginia Avenue being helpful identifiers.  The "keep left" and "keep right" instructions suggest curves or slight turns, which could be related to the ravine systems in that area.  The lack of street names for some turns lowers my confidence slightly. Potential nearby landmarks could include the Warden subway station or the Taylor Creek Park.
