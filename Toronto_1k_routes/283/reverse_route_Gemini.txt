Confidence: 90%

Lee Avenue, Benlamond Avenue, and Norwood Road provide strong anchors, making me highly confident in the reversed directions.  This route is in the east end, close to Danforth Avenue, which is a major commercial street. Potential landmarks might include businesses on Danforth, or perhaps a park like Monarch Park nearby.  Given the specific street names and the variety of turns, Iâ€™m quite confident in the overall reversal.
