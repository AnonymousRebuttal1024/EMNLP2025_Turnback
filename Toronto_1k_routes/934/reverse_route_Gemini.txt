Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the O'Connor-Parkview neighborhood of East York. The presence of Mendel and Keystone Avenues helps in placing the route.  The many turns suggest navigating smaller residential streets. I'm reasonably confident about the general flow, but precise reversal is challenging due to the many short segments and turns. Landmarks might include residential buildings or possibly a local school or park.
