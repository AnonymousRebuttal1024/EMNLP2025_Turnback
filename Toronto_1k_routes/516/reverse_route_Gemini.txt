Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route is quite long and complex, indicating a journey through a residential area, likely in Scarborough, possibly near Morningside Heights based on Morningside Avenue and Quebec Avenue. Wendigo Way also suggests a residential street. The "sharp" and "slight" turns, and "keep left/right", create some ambiguity, as their precise angles are unknown.  I'm reasonably confident about the main sections of the route, especially those along the named roads, but the many short segments and less precise turns make the exact reversal somewhat uncertain.
