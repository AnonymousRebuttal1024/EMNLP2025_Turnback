This route is very straightforward.  The long 1161.1-meter segment strongly suggests a major east-west arterial road, likely Queen Street West or King Street West, given the coordinates which place this in the downtown core near the Entertainment District.  The shorter segments at the beginning and end likely represent turns off/onto smaller streets or laneways.  The simplicity of this route makes the reversal highly reliable.  The general coordinates suggest potential proximity to landmarks like the TIFF Bell Lightbox or the Princess of Wales Theatre.
