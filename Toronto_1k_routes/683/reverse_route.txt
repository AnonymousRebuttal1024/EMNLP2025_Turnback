Explanation: The route touches various Toronto streets with a series of turns that necessitate thorough attention, like the transition onto St Luke Lane. Featuring a complex series of segments and both short and extended twists, urban interactions require careful oversight when retracing these paths. Despite this, orderly Toronto layouts underscore the trafficked street network allowing directed street cornering to propel sound re-acceleration through concentrated community avenues and intersections.
