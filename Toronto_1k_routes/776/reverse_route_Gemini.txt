Confidence: 90%

This route is relatively well-defined, thanks to the inclusion of several street names: Pears Avenue, Bedford Road, Admiral Road, Bernard Avenue, Brunswick Avenue, and Barton Avenue. This area, based on the coordinates and street names, is likely the Annex neighbourhood, just west of the University of Toronto.  Knowing these streets gives me a good anchor for visualizing the route. The short segments and turns likely represent smaller streets and intersections in this area. The "keep right" is a little ambiguous, but I've interpreted it as a minor curve in the road.  POIs near this route would include the University of Toronto and possibly some businesses along Bloor Street West.
