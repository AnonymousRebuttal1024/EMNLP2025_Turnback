Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in a residential area likely near the intersection of O'Connor Drive and Coxwell Avenue, judging by the coordinates and the relatively short distances involved.  The "keep right" instruction suggests a slight curve or bend in the road. The overall route is quite simple, making the reversal fairly straightforward. I have high confidence in the accuracy of the reversed directions, although minor discrepancies are always possible without a visual reference. I can't pinpoint specific landmarks from this information alone, but it's likely a typical residential area.
