Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Roncesvalles/Parkdale area, west of downtown, based on street names like Sorauren, Fuller, MacDonell, and Rideau.  While the named streets help, the numerous turns and short, unnamed segments make it difficult to retrace precisely from memory. I'm making educated guesses about the turns and the grid structure. Potential landmarks or POIs might include Sorauren Park and the surrounding residential neighborhood.
