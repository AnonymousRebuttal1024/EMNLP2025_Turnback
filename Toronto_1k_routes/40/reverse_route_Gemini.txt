Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: The reversal is fairly straightforward, following the original route in reverse.  The slight uncertainty (reducing confidence from 99% to 95%) stems from the many short segments and slight turns.  The precise reversing of these short segments and minor directional adjustments could vary slightly depending on the exact GPS data and mapping used.  The area appears to be residential, and while there are no major landmarks directly on the route, it is near the Liberty Village area in Toronto.
