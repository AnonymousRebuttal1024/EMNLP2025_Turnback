Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: St. Clarens Avenue provides a clear starting point, making the initial direction confident. The route has a few clear turns with long, straight sections suggesting major roads.  "Slight left" likely indicates a minor bend in the road. This makes reversal quite straightforward and boosts my confidence.  Potential POIs could include residential buildings along St. Clarens and potentially some commercial areas along the longer stretches, but it's hard to be specific without more context. Based on my general knowledge, this could be somewhere in the west end, perhaps near the Junction or Corso Italia areas, as these neighborhoods have streets named in this style.
