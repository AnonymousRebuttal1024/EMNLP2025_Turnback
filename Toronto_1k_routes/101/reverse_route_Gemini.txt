Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route involves a series of turns on smaller streets, but the street names (Ulster Street, Major Street) are recognizable in the area. The distances are plausible for city blocks in a residential area of Toronto.  The reversal is straightforward.  The area is residential, with houses as the primary POIs.  Minor uncertainty comes from the less familiar street names (Cyrill Lane, Kosower Lane, Sussex Mews), making it challenging to recall their precise relative positions without a map.
