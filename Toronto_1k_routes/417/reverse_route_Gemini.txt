Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Yonge and St. Clair area, likely near Cedarvale Park given Virginia Avenue and Barker Avenue. The numerous turns, short segments, and changes in direction (including "keep right/left") indicate a complex route through residential streets. This level of complexity lowers my confidence in the accuracy of the reversal without a visual aid.  Potential POIs could include Cedarvale Park or the shops along St. Clair Avenue West.
