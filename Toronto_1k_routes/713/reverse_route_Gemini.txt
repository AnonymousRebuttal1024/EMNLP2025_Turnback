Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be in the area just east of the Don Valley Parkway, starting near the intersection of Eastern Avenue and Logan Avenue and heading generally north towards Gerrard Street East.  The inclusion of East Don Roadway and Sackville Street helps place the route, providing good confidence for the reversal, especially for the middle portion. The longer stretches probably involve major streets like Eastern Avenue and perhaps Carlaw Avenue.  The initial and final shorter segments are slightly less certain, as their precise angles are unclear. Potential landmarks might include the Don Valley Parkway or the various industrial and commercial buildings in the area.
