**Confidence: 88%**

**Reason:** The directions involve a complicated series of turns, such as several consecutive lefts and rights, including the cross over King Liberty Bridge. These sections necessitate careful instructional reversal to ensure each path-leading turn and slight adjustment maintains trajectory order. Despite potential urban deviations and proximity of different pathways, a coherent sequence exists through explicit directives and characterized turns, resulting in high but slightly moderated confidence due to complexity variables.
