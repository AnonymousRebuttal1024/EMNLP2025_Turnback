This route seems to be in the Dovercourt-Wallace Emerson-Junction area, just north of Bloor Street.  I'm reasonably familiar with this neighborhood. Hope Street, Nairn Avenue, Harvie Avenue, McRoberts Avenue, and Innes Avenue are all residential streets located in that area. The shorter segments and turns are characteristic of this residential neighborhood.
