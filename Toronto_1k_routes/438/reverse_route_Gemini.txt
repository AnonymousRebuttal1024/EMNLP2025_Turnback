The specific street names (Silver Moon Drive and Annie Craig Drive) greatly assist in determining the location and likely route, which is in the Long Branch neighborhood in the west end of Toronto. This area is primarily residential.  The long stretch on what is likely Lake Shore Blvd W. (based on the 711m distance) makes the reversal quite straightforward, and the other streets appear to be smaller residential roads. The "keep right" instruction adds a bit of uncertainty, but the named streets provide strong anchors for the reversal.  Colonel Samuel Smith Park is potentially within a short distance of this route based on the coordinates.
