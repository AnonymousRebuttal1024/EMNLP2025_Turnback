Confidence: 95%

Explanation:  This route is relatively straightforward, heading east initially and then north. The long 1075.5m segment suggests a major east-west artery, likely Gerrard Street East or perhaps Shuter Street. Myer Willinsky Lane is a distinct landmark which strongly anchors the route.  I am highly confident about the reversal due to the clear landmarks and simple sequence of turns. The coordinates indicate it is south of Gerrard. Potential POIs include businesses along Gerrard Street East, residential buildings, and possibly Ryerson University if it is near the eastern end of the route.
