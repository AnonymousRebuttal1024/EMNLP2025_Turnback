Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route seems to navigate a mix of residential and potentially commercial areas, given the variety of street names and turns.  Shaw Street, Dewson Street, and Montrose Avenue are good anchors and point towards the west end, potentially near Trinity Bellwoods or west of it.  The "slight" turns and "keep left/right" instructions introduce ambiguity without a visual map, and the multiple shorter segments add to the difficulty of reconstructing the route precisely. Achtman Lane likely represents a smaller side street or laneway.
