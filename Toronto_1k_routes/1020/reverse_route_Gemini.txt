Confidence: 95%

Reasoning:  This route is in the Leslieville/Riverdale area east of the Don Valley Parkway.  I have very high confidence because of the inclusion of very specific street names like Thomas McClintock Lane, Antonios Mavrakakis Lane, Carlaw Avenue and Withrow Avenue. Carlaw Avenue is a major north-south artery in that area and anchors the route.  The lanes mentioned are accurately placed near the start of the journey, reflecting the laneway housing common in that neighbourhood. The route appears to proceed south towards Gerrard Street East, then follow Carlaw south before turning onto Withrow. Potential POIs could include Jimmie Simpson Park, the shops and restaurants along Queen Street East, and the Don Valley trails.
