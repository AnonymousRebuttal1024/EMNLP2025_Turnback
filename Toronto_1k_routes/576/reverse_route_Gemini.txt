Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be near the former railway lands south of Dupont Street, west of Dufferin Street. The inclusion of Turntable Crescent, Foundry Avenue, Harvie Avenue and Morrison Avenue makes me quite confident in the location and the reversed directions. "Sharp left" is translated as "slight right" assuming a less extreme turn. The area is characterized by a mix of industrial buildings, newer residential developments, and potentially some remaining railway infrastructure.  The names Turntable Crescent and Foundry Avenue hint at the area's industrial past.
