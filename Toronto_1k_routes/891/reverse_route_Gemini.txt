Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the Downsview area, north of Wilson Heights, possibly in a residential neighborhood with crescents and drives, based on the coordinates and the street names (St. Edmunds, Weybourne). The turns seem relatively straightforward, even with the "keep left" and "slight left", which adds to my confidence.  The short distances and residential nature suggest navigation within a smaller area like a crescent or cul-de-sac. Possible POIs include residential homes and perhaps a nearby park.
