Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to navigate a relatively small area, likely a few blocks. The instructions are clear and include a street name (Spice Mill Lane and Lombard Street), which helps significantly. I am familiar with the general street layout of Toronto and the presence of smaller streets like Spice Mill Lane near larger arteries, lending credibility to the directions. While I can't be 100% certain without visually inspecting the area, the sequence of turns and distances seems plausible. This area is likely near the Distillery District, which is known for its pedestrian-friendly streets and mixed-use development, including residential and commercial buildings.
