Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route seems to be confined to a relatively small area, likely within a residential neighborhood east of downtown, possibly in the Upper Beaches or Beach Hill area based on the coordinates.  The mix of short segments and "keep left/right" instructions suggest navigating around some potential bends or curves in the road layout. I'm pretty confident in the reversal due to the relatively straightforward sequence of turns and confined area, but without street names, there's a small chance of minor errors. POIs are hard to pinpoint specifically without more context, but likely would include residential buildings, perhaps a small local park, or a few businesses if it skirts a commercial street.
