Confidence: 75%

The presence of "Marmaduke Street" helps, as I can generally place that in the west end near High Park. This area is largely residential with a mix of houses and low-rise apartments. The short distances and frequent turns again suggest a fairly standard grid pattern, possibly with some minor alleyways or pedestrian shortcuts. The "sharp" turns add a bit of uncertainty, and the "keep left" instruction is somewhat ambiguous without a visual context. I have reasonably high confidence due to the street name and the generally predictable street layout in this area.  However, I cannot identify any major landmarks nearby other than potentially High Park itself being within a reasonable distance based on the general coordinates.
