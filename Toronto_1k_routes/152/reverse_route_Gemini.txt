Confidence: 98%

Reason: The route is quite straightforward, consisting mainly of long stretches with only a few short turns. The reversal is easy and the possibility of error is minimal.  The lack of street names reduces the geographical context slightly, but the directions are unambiguous and the distances are plausible.  I'd guess this is a route along major roads in Toronto, possibly near a highway,  due to the long distances involved.
