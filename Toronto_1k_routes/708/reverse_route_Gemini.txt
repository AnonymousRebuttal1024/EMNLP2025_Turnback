Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the Mount Pleasant West neighborhood, near the intersection of Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue East. The street names Manor Road East, De-Savery Crescent, Thurloe Avenue, and Acacia Road are helpful in determining the location.  The numerous short segments, "slight" turns, and "keep left/right" instructions suggest a complex route through residential streets with curves and potentially some smaller lanes or walkways. This makes me moderately confident, but without visual confirmation, the precise angles and some of the unnamed segments are less certain.  Potential landmarks might include the shops along Yonge Street, the residential buildings in the area, and possibly even glimpses of the Beltline Trail depending on the exact location.
