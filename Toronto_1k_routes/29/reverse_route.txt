**Confidence: 85%**

**Reason:** The navigation includes multiple "keep right" instructions, with numerous segments of consistent directional flow. While the route involves a straightforward series of minor roadways and directional turns, the consistent "keep right" commands and slight urban complexities call for careful consideration of each logical flow reversal step. The use of distinct street names such as Judith Drive and Milton Road aids orientation, yet slight variability might still arise from the repeated similar directional commands, contributing to a solid but slightly moderated confidence level.
