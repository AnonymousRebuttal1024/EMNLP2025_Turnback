Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route likely begins in the vicinity of Strachan Avenue and Bremner Boulevard, heading west and likely passing through the Exhibition Place grounds. The initial westward movement followed by a series of turns indicates navigating potentially smaller streets and paths within the area. Reaching a point near the intersection of Fort York Boulevard and Fleet Street is likely given the provided distance. However, without specific street names or landmarks, the exact path becomes less clear after the initial westward movement, hence the reduced confidence. Potential POIs could include the Exhibition Place, BMO Field, and residential areas near Fort York.
