Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route likely weaves through residential streets near Dentonia Park (Dentonia Park Avenue being a key indicator). The frequent "keep left" instructions suggest navigating slight curves or forks in the road, typical of residential areas.  The named streets (Dentonia Park Ave, Thora Ave) and Palmer Avenue at the start provide good reference points, increasing my confidence. Potential POIs could include Dentonia Park itself, residential homes, and possibly some local businesses along the route.  The area is likely in the east end of Toronto, perhaps near Danforth, given my knowledge of the city's geography.
