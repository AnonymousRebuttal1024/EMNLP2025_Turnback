Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route is quite complex with many turns, making me a little less confident in the reversal. The coordinates and mention of "Commercial Road" suggest a location possibly in the Leslieville/Riverdale area, an area with a mix of residential and industrial uses.  I'm familiar with the general area but not the specific small streets likely involved in this route.  POIs could include businesses along Queen Street East, which is likely nearby, as well as potential small parks and residential streets.  The numerous short segments suggest the route might navigate through smaller streets and possibly parking lots or alleyways, adding to the uncertainty.
