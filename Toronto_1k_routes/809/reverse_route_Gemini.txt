This route is a relatively simple one with a long straight section.  The coordinates place it likely just north of Bloor Street, somewhere between Christie and Bathurst. The long 929.1-meter segment suggests following a major street, possibly Dupont Street. The lack of specific street names makes it slightly harder to pinpoint, but the simplicity of the turns makes the reversal very straightforward.  A potential POI near this route could be Christie Pits Park, if it is indeed along Dupont Street.
