Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route uses street names that sound plausible within a residential area of Toronto.  The distances are reasonable for this type of road network.  Reversing the route is straightforward. The confidence is slightly lower because I do not have specific knowledge of the precise layout of these streets in relation to one another, but the overall route and the directions are plausible for a Toronto suburban area.  There is likely residential housing in this area.
