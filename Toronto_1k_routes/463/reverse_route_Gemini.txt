Confidence: 90%

The inclusion of the "Gatineau Corridor Recreation Trail" significantly boosts confidence. This trail is a linear park running North-South, parallel and very close to the Don Valley Parkway. This location is east of the Don River, near the intersection of Don Mills Road and the DVP. The mixture of longer and shorter street segments suggests a combination of main roads and local streets. The relatively complex turns imply a path that likely involves navigating a residential area. The recreation trail itself serves as a clear landmark. I am very confident in the reversal due to the named recreation trail and the relatively clear progression of turns.  There are no immediately obvious major landmarks nearby other than the trail itself and the Don Valley Parkway.
