Confidence: 65%

This route is quite complex with many turns, making me less certain about the reversal. The coordinates place it in the area near Regent Park and Dundas and Parliament, which can have a somewhat irregular street layout. The inclusion of Dan Leckie Way adds a specific landmark which helps. However,  multiple "keep right" instructions and several very short segments introduce ambiguity.  I'm assuming these short segments relate to crossings, small alleys, or building entrances.  While I've tried to maintain the logic of the route, the numerous turns make it more challenging to be perfectly accurate, and I don't have complete confidence in every turn reversal.  POIs near this route would include Regent Park itself and possibly some businesses along Dundas Street East.
