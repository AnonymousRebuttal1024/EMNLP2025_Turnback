Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route near Small's Creek in the east end involves a very intricate path through what sounds like parkland and residential streets. While I can visualize the general area and the presence of Small's Creek ravine and park, the numerous unnamed turns and the mixture of paths and streets make it hard to be very precise.  Street names like Moberly, Aldergrove, and Hanson help, but the overall complexity lowers my confidence. Potential landmarks in the area include the East Toronto Athletic Field and Taylor Creek Park.
