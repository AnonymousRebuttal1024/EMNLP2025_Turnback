Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route is in a primarily residential area of North York, likely near Bayview Village.  The inclusion of street names like Lea Avenue, Stickney Avenue, Parkhurst Boulevard, and Sutherland Drive strengthens my confidence as these sound like realistic street names for that area. The long stretch along Sutherland Drive is a good indicator of a main road in the neighborhood. While the "sharp" and "slight" turn qualifiers introduce a small degree of uncertainty, the overall sequence of turns and the distances seem plausible.  I am familiar with the general layout of this area, with winding residential streets connecting to larger arterial roads, and this route aligns with that pattern. Potential POIs near this route might include Bayview Village Shopping Centre, or some of the local parks and schools in the neighborhood.
