Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the area just east of Yonge Street and north of Bloor Street, in a neighbourhood like Summerhill. Marlborough Place, MacPherson Avenue, Gwen Egan Lane, Bernard Avenue, Madison Avenue and Spadina Road are all located there. The many turns and relatively short distances suggest navigating residential streets and laneways. The longer stretches on Marlborough and Madison provide some anchor points.  The presence of a laneway like Gwen Egan Lane adds complexity.  POIs might include the shops and restaurants on Yonge Street, residential buildings, and possibly a nearby park.
