Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Brockton Village area, possibly near Dundas Street West and Dufferin Street. The presence of Springhurst Avenue provides a good anchor point. The many turns and shorter segments suggest a residential area. I am quite confident about the mid-section of the reversed route thanks to the street name. I am a little less certain about the initial and final steps and have made some inferences about "keep left/right" and "sharp right" instructions.  Potential landmarks in the area could include small businesses and residential buildings.
