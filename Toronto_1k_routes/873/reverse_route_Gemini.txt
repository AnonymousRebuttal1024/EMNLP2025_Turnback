Explanation:  This route likely starts near Victoria Park Avenue and Lawrence Avenue East based on the coordinates.  I'm familiar with the major streets in this area, but this route involves a number of turns, including some "slight" turns which are harder to precisely reverse without being on the ground.  The "keep right" instructions also introduce some ambiguity. This area is generally residential and commercial. Potential POIs could include parks, schools, and businesses along Lawrence Avenue East.
