Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This is a relatively short route within what appears to be a residential neighborhood, possibly near the Danforth area. Hemlock Avenue, Maughan Crescent, and Battenberg Avenue are all local streets in that vicinity. The sequence of turns suggests a fairly localized path, possibly close to Taylor Creek Park. The "keep right" and "slight left" instructions introduce a small degree of uncertainty, but the overall simplicity and the presence of the named streets make me fairly confident in the reversed directions.
