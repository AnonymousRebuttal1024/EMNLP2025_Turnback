**Confidence: 90%**

**Reason:** This route has multiple turns that can be closely tracked and reversed logically. Named streets like MacDonell Avenue and Rideau Avenue provide confidence in pinpointing the reverse path. Maintaining correct directional cues and managing the switch of left/right actions has been carefully considered, along with a recognition of the overall path flow. However, given urban intricacies and potential changes in the environment (e.g., temporary obstacles or diversions), a slight margin of variability remains.
