Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the area just west of  the intersection of Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue West, possibly near Cedarvale Park, based on the street name Cedarvale Avenue. The sequence of turns suggests navigating residential streets.  The longer 550.3m and 446.3m segments likely correspond to major roads like Vaughan or Chaplin. The absence of more well-known street names, apart from Cedarvale, introduces some uncertainty. Potential POIs might include Cedarvale Park or the shops along St. Clair West.
