Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the area just north of Casa Loma, close to St. Clair West. The starting point appears to be on Rosemount Avenue based on the provided information. The route involves fewer turns than some of the other examples, and includes a long straight stretch (672.3 meters), making the reversal relatively straightforward. I'm fairly confident in the accuracy of the reversed directions, especially given the named street. Possible landmarks might include residential houses, Spadina Road, or perhaps a local parkette.
