Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the Annex neighborhood, potentially starting near the University of Toronto and heading somewhat southwest.  The presence of "St Luke Lane" provides a good landmark. The mix of shorter and longer segments suggests navigating both smaller streets and potentially a section of a larger road like Bloor Street or Spadina Avenue. I'm reasonably confident, but the several turns, and lack of other named streets, mean I can't be completely sure about the precise path without a visual aid.  POIs could include University of Toronto buildings near the start, or various shops and restaurants along Bloor Street if the route passes near it.
