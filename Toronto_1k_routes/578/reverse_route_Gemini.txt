Confidence: 70%

This route seems to be in a residential area, potentially near Kensington Market or the University of Toronto, given its central location.  The numerous short turns and segments suggest a dense street network.  The absence of street names makes pinpointing the exact location and identifying landmarks challenging. I'm moderately confident in the reversal logic, but the lack of specific street names and the presence of general directional instructions reduce the certainty.
