Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route is in the southern part of Toronto, near the lakeshore, possibly in the Humber Bay Shores or Mimico area west of downtown based on the coordinates. The mention of Marine Parade Drive anchors the end of the route and strongly supports this location. The "keep left" and "slight right" instructions suggest navigating along curved roads or following slight bends, potentially near the Humber Bay shoreline or parkland. The overall southwest-to-northeast movement and the inclusion of Marine Parade Drive make me fairly confident in the reversal, although the lack of other street names and the presence of some imprecise directional instructions (e.g., "slight right") introduce a degree of uncertainty. Potential POIs near this route could include Humber Bay Park, the Martin Goodman Trail, or the waterfront developments in Humber Bay Shores.
