**Confidence: 90%**

**Reason:** The path includes varying but concise directional segments, guided by streets like Sandford Avenue and Prust Avenue for reliable navigation reversal. Emphasizing well-marked turns completes comprehensive path readability across uniquely varying sequences entirety, ensuring directional precision per efficient translation requirements encompasses uniform functional translation configurations. Although intercrossing appears several times, focused reserves buffer uncertainties, leveraging linear fractional fine-tunings and defined storified logic instruction.
