Confidence: 80%

This route is likely somewhere near the downtown core, perhaps east of the Don Valley, given the somewhat longer stretches and fewer turns than the previous examples. This suggests larger, more arterial roads rather than residential streets. While the absence of street names reduces certainty, the relative simplicity of the route allows for a fairly confident reversal. The "slight left" instruction introduces a minor degree of uncertainty.  I can't identify specific landmarks without more information.
