Confidence: 90%

Reason: This route reversal is straightforward, following the steps in reverse order. The street names (Quebec Avenue, Pacific Avenue, Oakmount Road, Humberside Avenue, Indian Grove) are all located in a relatively localized area of Toronto, likely in the west end near High Park.  My slight reduction in confidence from 95% comes from the possibility of slight variations in the distances provided, and the lack of landmarks which might easily orient someone. While I can confidently reverse the steps provided, the actual on-the-ground experience could have small differences in turn angles or distances.
