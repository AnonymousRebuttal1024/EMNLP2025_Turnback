Confidence: 98%

Reasoning: The reversal is highly confident because the route is relatively straightforward with clear turns and street names, and relatively long distances, minimizing potential errors from small inaccuracies. The only potential source of minor error comes from the slight right turn which is slightly subjective.  The area is residential, near the Don Valley, and there aren't any major landmarks directly on the route.
