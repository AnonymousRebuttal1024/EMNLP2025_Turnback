Confidence: 90%

Reasoning:  Jarvis Street, Allan Sparrow Lane, Charles Street East, and Collier Street are all good landmarks. The route has a mix of short and longer segments with turns, but the street names provide context, increasing my confidence. The "keep right/left" suggest minor course adjustments, likely to stay on the named roads. Potential POIs would include businesses and residences along Jarvis and Charles, possibly some small businesses or residential buildings around Allan Sparrow Lane, and residential houses or apartments along Collier. I am very confident about the start and end points because of Jarvis and Collier Streets.  This area is very likely in downtown Toronto, near Church and Wellesley, given my knowledge of the city's street network.
