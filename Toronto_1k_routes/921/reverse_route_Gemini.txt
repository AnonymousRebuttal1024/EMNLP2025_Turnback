Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the neighborhood of York Mills and Bathurst Street, a bit northwest of downtown. I recognize street names like Brucewood, Kirkland, Varna, Fairholme, Dell Park, Elway, and Marlee, which gives me confidence in the general layout. The turns are a mix of onto major and minor streets, typical of suburban navigation. However, the precise angles of "slight" turns and the presence of any small cul-de-sacs or driveways add some uncertainty. Landmarks near this route might include residential homes, parks like Fairholme Park or Dell Park, and perhaps a local school.
