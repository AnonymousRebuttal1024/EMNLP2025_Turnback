Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route is relatively straightforward, with a long stretch along a single street. The coordinates suggest a location possibly near Gerrard Street East and Carlaw Avenue. I'm reasonably familiar with the general layout of that area. The simplicity of the route gives me high confidence in the reversed directions. Potential POIs in this area could include small businesses, restaurants, and residential buildings.
