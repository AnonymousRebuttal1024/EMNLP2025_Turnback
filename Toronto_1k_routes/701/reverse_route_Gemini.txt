Confidence: 90%

This route is likely in the Hillcrest neighbourhood, specifically near the intersection of St. Clair Avenue West and Dufferin Street.  The inclusion of Tyrrel Avenue, Alberta Avenue, Rosemount Avenue, Via Italia (which is a segment of St. Clair West known for its Italian businesses), and MacKay Avenue provides very strong evidence for this location, and makes me confident in the reversal.  This area has a mix of residential and commercial buildings, with St. Clair West being a major commercial corridor.  Wychwood Barns Park is a potential nearby landmark.
