Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the west end, likely in the Brockton Village area, based on the street names (Sunnyside, Wright, Rideau, Lansdowne, Shirley) and the coordinates. I'm reasonably familiar with Lansdowne and Sunnyside as being near each other, and Wright Avenue as being a longer street in that area.  The presence of several shorter segments and turns makes me somewhat less confident in the exact path, especially without being able to visualize smaller streets like Rideau and Shirley.  POIs might include residential houses, and businesses and restaurants are likely a short walk away on Dundas Street West.
