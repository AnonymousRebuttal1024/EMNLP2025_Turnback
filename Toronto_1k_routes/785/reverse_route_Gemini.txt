Confidence: 95%

This route is within the University of Toronto's St. George campus, highly likely given the mentions of King's College Road, King's College Circle and Hart House Circle. These are very clear landmarks. I am very familiar with the campus layout. The starting point is likely near the Huron-Sussex neighbourhood, and the endpoint is closer to Harbord Street. While the route has many short segments, which can be slightly ambiguous in their exact meaning (small jogs, building entrances, etc.), the strong landmarks give me great confidence in the overall reversal.  POIs would obviously include University of Toronto buildings, Hart House, and Convocation Hall.
