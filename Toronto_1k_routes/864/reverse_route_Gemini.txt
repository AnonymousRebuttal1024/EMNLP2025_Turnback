Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: Northline Road, Southmead Road, Engelhart Crescent, and Sundridge Drive provide excellent landmarks.  The "sharp right" also offers a distinct turn. These factors and the relatively low number of instructions increase my confidence in reversing the route accurately.  The area is probably residential, judging by the street names. Potential POIs include homes along these streets, and possibly a nearby park or school. This is likely in the northeast part of Toronto, perhaps near Don Mills, based on similar routes and my knowledge of Toronto's geography.
