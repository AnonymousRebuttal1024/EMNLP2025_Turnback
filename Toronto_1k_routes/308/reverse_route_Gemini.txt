Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the East York area of Toronto, possibly near the intersection of Plains Road and Coxwell Avenue.  Plains Road and St. Hubert Avenue are real streets in this area, and Leroy Avenue is nearby as well.  The combination of turns suggests navigating the residential streets. The absence of a major arterial road as a clear reference point, combined with the shorter segments, makes it slightly less certain. Possible POIs might include the shops and restaurants along Coxwell Avenue and residential buildings.
