Confidence: 95%

This route is likely in the Birch Cliff neighborhood of Scarborough, east of Victoria Park Avenue. The presence of Glenburn Avenue, Tiago Avenue, Squires Avenue, Furnival Road, Valor Boulevard, and Merritt Road provides strong evidence for the location. This area is mostly residential with a mix of housing types. My confidence is very high because of the specific street names, which allow for precise reconstruction of the reversed route.  Potential landmarks could include Birch Cliff Public School and the surrounding residential area.
