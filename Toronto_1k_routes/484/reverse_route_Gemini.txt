Confidence: 70%

Reasoning:  This route goes through a residential neighborhood, likely the Annex area, characterized by smaller streets and a mix of houses and low-rise apartments. The street names like Lippincott, Harbord, Markham, London, and Palmerston are helpful landmarks. However, the many unnamed turns, combined with the short distances, make it tricky to reconstruct perfectly from memory.  Palmerston Square being a small park adds a recognizable feature. I'm reasonably sure about the main streets but the smaller turns and lanes reduce my overall confidence.
