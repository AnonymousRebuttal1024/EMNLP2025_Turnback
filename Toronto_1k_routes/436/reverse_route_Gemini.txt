Confidence: 75%

This route is quite long and complex, likely in a residential area possibly near Victoria Park and Lawrence Avenues East, judging by the coordinates and frequent turns. Cranfield Road and Northline Road are mentioned.  The multiple "sharp" turns and the "keep left" instruction make the reversal somewhat more challenging without a visual aid. Northline Road appears to be traversed twice in opposite directions, suggesting a loop or a complex street configuration. I'm reasonably confident, but there's a higher chance of errors due to the route's complexity and lack of a complete street map for reference.  I cannot identify any major landmarks beyond the mentioned street names.
