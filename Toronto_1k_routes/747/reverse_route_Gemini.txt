Confidence: 75%

Reasoning:  This route appears to be in the Cabbagetown area south of Wellesley, with Huntley Street being a key indicator.  The many short segments and turns, especially at the end, make precise reversal somewhat challenging. I'm relying on a general understanding of the area's street layout.  Potential landmarks might include Riverdale Farm or the Don Valley Parkway, depending on how close the route is to them.
