Confidence: 95%

Explanation: This route starts near Yonge and The Esplanade, heading south initially on Victoria Street.  The presence of Yonge and Victoria streets provides strong anchors, and the distances seem plausible for that area.  The multiple "keep left" instructions likely represent navigating slight curves or lane changes.  I have very high confidence in the reversal because of the clear landmarks and relatively straightforward route.  POIs include the St. Lawrence Market north of the starting point, and various businesses along Yonge and Front Streets.
