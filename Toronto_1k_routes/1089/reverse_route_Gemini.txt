Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: The inclusion of very specific locations within the Eaton Centre, as well as Irwin Avenue, St. Nicholas Street, St. Joseph Street, and Breadalbane Street makes me highly confident in the reversal. This route starts near the University of Toronto and heads generally southeast towards the Eaton Centre. The named streets provide excellent landmarks, and the detailed Eaton Centre instructions offer precise guidance. POIs include the University of Toronto campus, the shops and restaurants along Bloor St W and Yonge St, and of course, the Eaton Centre itself.
