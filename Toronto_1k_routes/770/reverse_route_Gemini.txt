Confidence: 85%

This route is in a residential area likely north of York Mills based on the coordinates. I'm reasonably confident in the reversal, as it seems to follow a logical path through a grid-like street network. The "keep right" instruction is a little ambiguous, but I've interpreted it as a slight curve rather than a full turn. The short 7.8-meter segment at the end suggests a small cul-de-sac or driveway, which makes the reversal straightforward. Some possible POI could be small parks in this region, like Dane Park.
