Confidence: 92%

Reason: The route is fairly straightforward with the inclusion of street names (Victor Avenue, Broadview Avenue, Bridgepoint Drive), which significantly aids in the reversal and gives a reasonably precise location in Toronto.  However, the presence of "keep right" instructions and "slight left/right" turns introduces a small degree of uncertainty.  The longer stretches give a good positional sense, but precise distances might be slightly off in real life.  The area is likely near a hospital or medical facility based on the street names.
