Confidence: 90%

Explanation: The route reversal utilized clear street names, such as Mutual Street and Granby Street, which are prominent in the downtown Toronto area, helping ensure directional fidelity throughout the sequence. The reversal was performed systematically, accounting for turns and directions that reflect the shared street network common within the University neighborhood or adjacent to Ryerson University. By methodically inverting the series of directional moves, I have high confidence in the correctness of this directional path given the consistent road structure and landmark references common to this part of the city.
