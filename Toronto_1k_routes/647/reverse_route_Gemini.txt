Confidence: 60%

Explanation: This route seems to start near Liberty Village and heads roughly east towards the Entertainment District, ending near Wellington St W and Portland St. The mention of Garrison Crossing and Portland Street, along with Wellington Street West at the end, are good landmarks. However, the numerous "Continue straight" instructions and many turns, combined with some vague "slight left/right" make it hard to accurately reconstruct the route mentally without a map. This complexity reduces my confidence. Potential POIs might include the Exhibition Place grounds if the route is near the western end, or restaurants and theaters as it moves eastward toward the Entertainment District.
