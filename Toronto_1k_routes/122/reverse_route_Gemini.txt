Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route involves a series of turns through what seems to be a residential area. The street name Durant Avenue sounds plausible for Toronto, but I don't have a perfect mental image of the precise layout of all the streets involved. The distances seem reasonable for city blocks.  Reversing the directions is straightforward. The slight reduction in confidence stems from the lack of familiarity with the smaller streets and their arrangement relative to one another in the area.  There would be residential buildings near this route.
