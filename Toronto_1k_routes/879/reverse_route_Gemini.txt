Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route appears to be near the Rosedale/Summerhill area, potentially starting near Yonge Street and heading towards the Don Valley Parkway, judging by the coordinates and length of one of the steps (1070 meters). I'm familiar with the general area, but the many turns, including "slight" and "sharp" turns, make it difficult to reconstruct the exact path mentally.  Erindale Avenue helps place the end of the route more precisely. The many short segments and changes in direction decrease my confidence, and I'm not certain of specific POIs beyond residential buildings.
