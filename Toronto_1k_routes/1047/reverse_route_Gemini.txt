Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Swansea neighborhood, potentially near High Park. The inclusion of Beresford Avenue, Waller Avenue, and Saint Olaves Road greatly increases my confidence.  These are all real streets in the area, and their sequence makes geographical sense. Beresford is a long north-south street in this area, making the 607.6m stretch likely along that road. The "keep left/right" instructions likely indicate slight curves or navigation through intersections. Potential POIs near this route could include High Park, the shops along Bloor West, or the residential areas surrounding the mentioned streets.
