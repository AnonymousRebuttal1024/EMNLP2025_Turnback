Confidence: 90%

Sunnyside Avenue provides a good anchor, and the turns are fairly straightforward. The "slight left" introduces minor uncertainty, but the overall brevity and simplicity of the route contribute to my confidence. This area is in the west end, near the lakefront and High Park. Possible landmarks include the Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion, the amusement park, or the nearby residential streets.
