Confidence: 70%

This route seems to be in the Yorkdale/Glen Park neighborhood, potentially close to Yorkdale Shopping Centre. Regent Road, Maniza Road, Wilson Avenue, and Bridgeland Avenue are present in that area, though I'm not certain about their precise layout. The high number of short segments and turns suggests a complicated route, possibly involving pedestrian pathways or parking lot navigation, which decreases my confidence.  The area is mixed residential and commercial, with Yorkdale Shopping Centre a prominent landmark, although its proximity to the route isn't clear from the given directions.
