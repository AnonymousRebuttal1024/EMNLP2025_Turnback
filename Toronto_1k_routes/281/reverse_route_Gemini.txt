Confidence: 90%

St. James Avenue and Bleecker Street provide excellent anchors, giving me high confidence. The "slight left" and "keep left" instructions add some minor ambiguity, but the overall structure is well-defined.  This route is in the Cabbagetown area, known for its Victorian architecture.  Potential landmarks include Riverdale Farm, the numerous Victorian homes, and possibly some smaller businesses along Parliament Street, which is nearby.
