Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: This route is within the Eaton Centre mall, based on the repeated mentions of "Eaton Centre level 1," "Eaton Centre level 2," and escalators between levels. The starting point is likely near the intersection of Queen Street West and Yonge Street. The various turns and short distances correspond to navigating within the mall's corridors. I have very high confidence in the reversed directions due to the highly specific location information.  POIs are, of course, shops and restaurants within the Eaton Centre itself, as well as Dundas Square and Yonge-Dundas Square right outside.
