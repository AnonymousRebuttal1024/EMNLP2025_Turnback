Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in Liberty Village, just west of downtown Toronto. The presence of Temple Avenue, Tyndall Avenue, and Jameson Avenue confirms this location. The "keep right" instructions suggest navigating around some of the curved roads within Liberty Village.  Potential landmarks include the various shops, restaurants, and condo buildings in Liberty Village, as well as the Exhibition Place grounds nearby.  The named streets and relatively straightforward route give me good confidence.
