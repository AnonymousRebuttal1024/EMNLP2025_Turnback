Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the Casa Loma area, likely near Poplar Plains Road and Clarendon Avenue.  These are residential streets in a relatively quiet part of the city. The short distances and few turns suggest a fairly localized route. My confidence is 90% because the streets are familiar and the directions are straightforward.  However, as always, minor on-the-ground adjustments might be needed, especially considering potential one-way streets. Possible POIs near this route include residential houses and possibly a nearby park or ravine.
