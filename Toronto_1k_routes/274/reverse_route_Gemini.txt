Confidence: 90%

Montrose Avenue provides a good anchor, and the turns are relatively straightforward.  The "slight right" adds a little ambiguity, but the overall simplicity of the route boosts confidence. This area is residential, west of Casa Loma. Potential landmarks could include the Casa Loma grounds to the east, or residential buildings and perhaps local parks along the route.
