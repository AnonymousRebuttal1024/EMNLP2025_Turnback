Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: Elwood Boulevard provides a good starting landmark.  The long straight segment ("keep right") suggests a major road, possibly Avenue Road, and the short segments at the end likely represent a driveway or small side street. The relatively few instructions and the specific starting point boost my confidence. POIs could include residential buildings along Elwood and potentially some businesses along the main road. Based on the starting coordinates and street name style, I believe this is in the north-central part of Toronto, possibly near the intersection of Avenue Road and Eglinton or St. Clair.
