Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be in the Lawrence Park South area based on the street names (Dell Park, Shermount, Glen Park, Dalemount, Hillmount) and coordinates. These provide a clear and well-structured path, giving me a high degree of confidence in the reversal. The route is relatively straightforward, involving primarily longer stretches along named streets. Potential POI near this area could be Alexander Muir Memorial Gardens.
