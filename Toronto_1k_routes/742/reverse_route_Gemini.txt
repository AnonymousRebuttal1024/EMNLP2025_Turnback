Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be just north of the downtown core, possibly near the University of Toronto or the Annex neighborhood. The initial long eastward segment gives a strong directional cue. The later turns seem to be on smaller streets, possibly within a residential area.  The lack of street names for many of the turns makes it a bit harder to be absolutely certain about the reversal. Potential landmarks could include Bathurst Street or Spadina Avenue, depending on the precise location.
