Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Junction/Runnymede area of Toronto, west of the downtown core. The presence of Old Stock Yards Road, Runnymede Road, Liverpool Street, and Pritchard Avenue strongly anchors the route and contributes to my high confidence. The numerous turns and varying segment lengths suggest navigating the residential streets and industrial areas common in this part of the city. Potential POIs near this route could include the Stock Yards Village shopping center, Runnymede Public School, or the industrial businesses along St. Clair Avenue West.
