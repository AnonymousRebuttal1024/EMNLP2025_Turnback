Confidence: 80%

This route seems to start near the southern edge of the Entertainment District and head north towards the core. The long 711-meter segment makes me think it's using a major street like Spadina Avenue or Bathurst Street.  The rest of the directions suggest navigating smaller streets, perhaps in the Fashion District or towards Chinatown. My confidence is around 80%. The initial and middle sections seem fairly straightforward to reverse, but without a map, I'm less sure about the smaller streets, especially those near the start.  One-way streets could easily complicate the reversal. Possible POIs near the start might include restaurants and bars in the Entertainment District.  Further north, POIs could include clothing stores, art galleries, and restaurants in the Fashion District or Chinatown.
