Confidence: 85%

Explanation: The instructions were reversed while ensuring the continuity of the road network where directional changes were consistent with typical street layouts in downtown Toronto. The route likely traverses through areas near Ryerson University and St. Michael's Hospital, and the proximity to known intersections provides extra confidence. However, the condensed nature of downtown streets introduces a slight uncertainty without map verification.
