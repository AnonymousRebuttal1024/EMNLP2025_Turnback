Confidence: 95%

This route appears to be in the Forest Hill South neighborhood.  The street names Danesbury, Glengrove, Lois, and Wenderly give me very high confidence in the route and its reversal. These are distinct streets in a well-defined area.  Likely, the route starts near Eglinton Avenue West.  The area is primarily residential.
