Confidence: 90%

The abundance of street names (Caledonia Road, Summit Avenue, Bronoco Avenue, Blackthorn Avenue) significantly increases my confidence in the accuracy of the reversed directions.  The terms "sharp left/right" and "slight right" suggest distinct turns, further aiding in navigation. This area appears to be residential, possibly with a mix of houses and low-rise apartments.  I'm confident in the general flow of the route.  This area is in the west end, near the Humber River valley. Possible landmarks might include schools, parks, or small local businesses.
