Confidence: 80%

Reasoning:  This route is in the Junction Triangle area near Dundas West and Dupont.  I'm reasonably familiar with the main streets like Dundas and Dupont, and the presence of named streets like Pelham Avenue, Laughton Avenue, Osler, and Lindner helps.  However, the inclusion of some unnamed segments and smaller residential streets like Pelham Park Gardens reduces my certainty slightly. I am visualizing the grid pattern and general layout of the area, but the smaller streets can be challenging to place with absolute precision mentally. Potential landmarks or POIs might include the Annette Street Public School and the surrounding residential neighborhood.
