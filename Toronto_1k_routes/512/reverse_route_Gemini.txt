Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route seems to be within a residential area north-west of Toronto, likely near or in York University Heights. The presence of streets like Rosewell Avenue, Cheritan Avenue, and Cortland Avenue suggests this, as they are all located in that general vicinity.  The roundabout on Cheritan Avenue provides a significant landmark. The "sharp" turns and the "keep right/left" instruction make precise reversal somewhat ambiguous without a visual map. I'm reasonably confident about the segments along named streets and around the roundabout but less so about the shorter, unnamed connecting parts.
