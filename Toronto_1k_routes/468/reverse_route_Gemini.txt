Confidence: 85%

The inclusion of "Ardagh Street", "Durie Street", "Colbeck Street", "Beresford Avenue" and "Runnymede Road" makes me quite confident about this route. These street names clearly place the route in the Bloor West Village area.  This area is largely residential with commercial activity concentrated along Bloor Street West. The many turns and short distances suggest navigating the local residential grid. Runnymede Road itself is a more significant north-south road in the area. The "slight right" introduces some minor uncertainty without a visual map, but overall, the street names allow for a reliable reversal. High Park is a likely nearby landmark given the general location.
