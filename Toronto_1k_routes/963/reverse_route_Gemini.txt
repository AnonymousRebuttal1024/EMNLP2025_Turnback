Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be in the Junction Triangle.  I'm familiar with Durie Street, Ardagh Street, Colbeck Street, and Kennedy Avenue in that area.  They form a reasonably consistent grid pattern. While there are a couple of short segments, they are less frequent than in the previous examples and could represent pedestrian shortcuts or slight offsets.  The presence of named streets increases my confidence in the accuracy of the reverse directions.  This area is generally residential with some light industrial/commercial uses.
