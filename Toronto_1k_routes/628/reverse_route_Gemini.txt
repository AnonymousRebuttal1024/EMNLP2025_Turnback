Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route starts near the waterfront, likely south of the Gardiner Expressway, and moves generally east.  The mention of Taylor's Wharf Lane and George Street South provides good landmarks, and suggests it's likely near the eastern edge of downtown, possibly close to the St. Lawrence Market area. The initial northeast direction suggests going along the Esplanade or a similar road. I'm reasonably confident due to those named streets. However, there are several unnamed segments, and the area can be a bit complex with on/off ramps for the expressway, which lowers my certainty slightly. POIs might include the St. Lawrence Market, parks along the waterfront, or various restaurants and businesses in the area.
