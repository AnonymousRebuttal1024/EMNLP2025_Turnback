This route seems to be near the intersection of O'Connor Drive and Cosburn Avenue in East York.  Cedarvale Avenue and Holborne Avenue are located in that area. The "Keep Right" instruction might relate to navigating a slight curve or split in the road. This area is primarily residential. The presence of named streets makes me reasonably confident in the reversed directions.
