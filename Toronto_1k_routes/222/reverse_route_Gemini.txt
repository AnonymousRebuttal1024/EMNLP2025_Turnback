Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route involves a series of turns and street names, some of which are less common. While I can reverse the directions, the less familiar street names and the number of turns slightly decrease my confidence. The area is residential and may be near a park or green space, but specific landmarks are not easily identifiable from the given directions.
