Confidence: 70%

Reasoning:  This route involves a number of turns in what seems like a residential area (Pullan Place, John Street, Phoebe Street). I'm assuming "slight left" and "slight right" indicate minor changes in direction.  The specific street names give me some anchor points, but the numerous turns and lack of major landmarks reduce my confidence.  Potential POIs in this area could include residential buildings along the named streets and possibly a small local parkette.  The area is likely west of downtown, potentially near Trinity Bellwoods, based on my general knowledge of Toronto's street layout.
