Confidence: 90%

Reasoning:  Woodlawn Avenue East, Crown's Lane, Marlborough Avenue, and MacPherson Avenue provide strong location anchors. This, along with a reasonable number of turns, makes me quite confident in the reverse navigation. The area is likely residential given the street names. POIs might include homes along these streets, and potentially a small park or local shops. Based on my understanding of Toronto, this area is probably in the central east, near the Danforth or Greektown neighborhoods.
