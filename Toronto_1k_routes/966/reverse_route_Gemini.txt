This route seems to be in the Warden and Lawrence area, potentially near Don Mills and Lawrence. I recognize the general pattern of streets in this area, but without specific street names, I can't be certain about the precise route.  The mix of longer and shorter segments makes it a plausible walking route, though it could involve some off-road paths or shortcuts. This area is largely residential with some commercial areas along major roads.
