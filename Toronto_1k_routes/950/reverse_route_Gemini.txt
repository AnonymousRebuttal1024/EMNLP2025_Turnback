Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in North York, near the intersection of Bayview and York Mills. Broadway Avenue and Rapert Road are good anchoring points.  Wellness Way likely refers to a smaller street or path, perhaps within a park or a new development. The long segments along Bayview/the Don Valley Parkway and then north towards York Mills make the general trajectory clear, but the presence of "Wellness Way" and a few turns without clear street names introduces some uncertainty. Landmarks might include residential buildings, parkland along the Don River, and possibly some office buildings closer to York Mills.
