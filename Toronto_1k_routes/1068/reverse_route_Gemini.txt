Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the Dovercourt-Wallace Emerson-Junction area, possibly near Bloor St W. Without street names, I'm relying on the relatively few steps and moderate distances to construct the reverse route.  I'm moderately confident about the general northward direction to reverse the initial southward movement. However, without more specific landmarks, pinpointing the exact turns adds some uncertainty. POIs in this general vicinity could include the shops and restaurants along Bloor St W, or possibly Dufferin Grove Park depending on the precise location.
