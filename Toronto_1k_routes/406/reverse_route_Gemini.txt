Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the West Don Lands/Corktown area, near the Distillery District. The presence of Front Street East and East Don Roadway provide some anchoring points. Tannery Road likely refers to a smaller street within this post-industrial area.  The numerous turns and variety of distances suggest navigation through a mixed-use area with some potentially irregular street patterns. Therefore, I'm reasonably confident, but the complexity warrants some caution, hence 75%. Potential POIs could include the Distillery District, the shops and restaurants along Front Street East, or perhaps the new developments in the West Don Lands.
