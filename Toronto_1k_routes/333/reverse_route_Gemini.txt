Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route seems to be in a residential area, likely east of the Don Valley Parkway, based on the coordinates and street names.  Floyd Avenue and Woodycrest Avenue are fairly distinct, boosting my confidence. The turns suggest navigating a local street grid.  The relatively short distances reinforce the localized nature of the route.  Potential POIs could include residential homes, perhaps a small park or local businesses.
