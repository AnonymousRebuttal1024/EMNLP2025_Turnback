Confidence: 98%

Reasoning:  The reversal is highly confident because the route is relatively straightforward with clear turns and street names.  The slight uncertainty comes from the very short segments (3.3 meters, 3.8 meters, etc.) and the potential for minor variation in the exact turning points, especially with "slight" turns.  The area is near the downtown core, with many smaller streets.  While no major landmarks are directly on the route, it passes through a neighborhood with many residential buildings and is close to the St. Lawrence Market area.
