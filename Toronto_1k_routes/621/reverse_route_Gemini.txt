Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route appears to navigate from somewhere west of Trinity Bellwoods Park, moving east towards the Moss Park area. The route incorporates major streets like Jack Layton Way and smaller residential streets. I am relatively confident due to the mention of these larger streets that help anchor the route. The final destination on Victor Avenue suggests a residential area.  The many turns make it somewhat challenging to track precisely in reverse, hence the slightly lower confidence. Potential POIs might include Trinity Bellwoods Park at the western end, and Moss Park closer to the east, along with businesses along Queen Street West.
