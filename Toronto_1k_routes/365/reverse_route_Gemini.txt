Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the East York area, potentially near the intersection of Mortimer Avenue and Coxwell Avenue. Fielding Avenue and Dewhurst Boulevard are good indicators.  The multiple turns suggest navigating residential streets. Potential POIs include residential homes, possibly Stan Wadlow Park (a bit to the east), and businesses along Coxwell Avenue. I'm fairly confident, especially with the named streets, though the shorter, unnamed segments introduce a little uncertainty.
