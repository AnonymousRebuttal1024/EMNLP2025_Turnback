Confidence: 98%

Reasoning: The reversal is highly confident due to the straightforward nature of the route. The street names and their sequence are easily identifiable, and their relative positions are accurate.  The only potential source of minor error could be slight variations in the exact turning points because of the "slight left" turn, but the overall route's logic is sound. The area is likely residential or a mix of residential and commercial buildings,  and  no major landmarks are directly mentioned on the route.
