Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be in a residential area, potentially near Moore Park or Rosedale, judging by the mention of Millwood Road and Balliol Street, which are in those neighborhoods. The many turns and relatively short distances suggest a winding street layout typical of these areas. My confidence is 85% because while I am familiar with the general area, I am relying on my knowledge of the typical street layout.  Without a map, I cannot be entirely certain of the precise configuration of every small street or laneway.  Potential POIs near this route could include parks, schools, and local shops.
