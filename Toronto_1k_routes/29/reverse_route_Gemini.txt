Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: My confidence is 70% because this route is heavily reliant on "keep right" and "keep left" instructions over long distances. While the named streets (Judith Drive, Milton Road, Plains Road, Derwyn Road) help, the lack of specific turn angles or intermediate landmarks makes precise reversal challenging. The long segments with "keep right/left" instructions increase the uncertainty about the exact path.  Without detailed map data, I am less confident in accurately reversing this route compared to those with more distinct turning points and named streets for shorter distances.  The overall direction is clear but the exact path may vary slightly in reality.
