Confidence: 85%

Reasoning:  This route is likely just west of Yonge Street near St. Clair Avenue West, given the mention of Raglan Avenue. The numerous short segments and turns suggest navigating smaller residential streets, possibly with laneways. My confidence is high due to the known street name and the generally predictable grid pattern in this area, but there's still some uncertainty due to the potential for alleys or small deviations in the path. Potential landmarks might include residential buildings, shops along St. Clair, or possibly the ravine system that runs through this part of Toronto.
