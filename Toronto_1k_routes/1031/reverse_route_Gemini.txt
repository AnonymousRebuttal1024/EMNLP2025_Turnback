Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the Wychwood neighbourhood, west of downtown Toronto, near Bathurst and St. Clair.  The specific mention of Benson Avenue, Wychwood Avenue, and Hocken Avenue provides high confidence, as these are all real streets in that area.  The route seems to navigate a fairly localized path within the neighborhood. The mix of shorter and longer segments indicates a combination of residential streets and potentially a short stretch along a slightly larger road. Potential POIs near this route could include Hillcrest Park, the shops and restaurants along St. Clair West, or the Wychwood Barns community centre.
