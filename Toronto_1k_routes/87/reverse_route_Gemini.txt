Confidence: 85%

Reason: The route seems plausible, involving a series of turns along what could be a residential area in Toronto. However, I don't recognize the street names “Denton Avenue” and “Newman Avenue” specifically.  The distances given are within a reasonable range for city streets. The reversal is straightforward, but the lack of familiarity with the specific streets reduces my confidence.  There is no information about nearby POIs due to the lack of familiar street names.
