Confidence: 65%

This route seems to be in the Liberty Village area, possibly near Exhibition Place. Sloping Sky Mews, Gzowski Boulevard, and Angelique Street are indicative of that newer development area south of King Street West.  The very high number of turns and short segments strongly suggests a complex pedestrian route potentially utilizing walkways, courtyards, and smaller paths that don't fully correspond to the street grid.  This decreases my confidence.  This area is a mix of residential condos, commercial spaces, and parkland.
