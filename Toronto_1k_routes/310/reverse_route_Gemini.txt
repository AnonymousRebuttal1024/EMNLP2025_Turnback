Reasoning: This route likely starts near the intersection of Bathurst Street and College Street, heading south towards Queen Street West. The long 1186.4-meter stretch suggests a significant portion along a major road like Bathurst or Spadina.  The smaller turns likely navigate the side streets.  While the lack of street names introduces some uncertainty, the overall structure of the route is relatively clear. POIs might include the University of Toronto, Kensington Market, and various businesses along Queen West.
