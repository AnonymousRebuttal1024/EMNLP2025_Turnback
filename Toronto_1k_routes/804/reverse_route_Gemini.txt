Confidence: 75%

This route appears to be in the Forest Hill/ Chaplin Estates area, likely north of Eglinton and east of Avenue Road, based on the coordinates and street names Ridge Hill Drive, Glenarden Road, Gloucester Grove, Winona Drive, Alameda Avenue, Clovelly Avenue, Bude Street, and Eleanor Avenue.  These names are helpful, but the route is quite intricate, including several "keep left/right" instructions that suggest curves, adding ambiguity. The shorter, unnamed segments also make the precise path harder to visualize.  Potential POIs might include the Oriole Park or businesses along Eglinton Avenue West.
