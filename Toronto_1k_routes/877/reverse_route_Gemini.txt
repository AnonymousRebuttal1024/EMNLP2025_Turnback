Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route involves a significant portion along the West Belt Line Trail, a recognizable feature.  The coordinates suggest a location in the York area, near Eglinton Avenue West and Black Creek Drive.  I'm reasonably familiar with the major roads in that area. I'm confident in the reversal along the trail itself, and Tommy Douglas Gardens likely represents a side street or access point. Potential POIs might include parks and residential areas near the trail.  Caledonia Road is likely a nearby main street. The combination of a known trail and relatively few other turns boosts my confidence.
