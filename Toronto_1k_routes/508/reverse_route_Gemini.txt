Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route seems to be located in a residential area in the northwest of Toronto, possibly near or in Smithfield. The presence of Flamborough Drive and Pilgrim Court as named roads increases confidence. The long stretches along these roads suggest they might be main arteries within the neighborhood.  The "Keep left" instruction indicates a possible fork or curve. The initial southwest direction and the relatively straightforward sequence of turns make me fairly confident in the reversed route.
