Confidence: 85%

Reason: This route is complex with many short segments and slight turns, making precise reversal challenging.  The inclusion of street names (Pine Avenue, Malvern Avenue, Wayland Avenue, Swanwick Avenue) provides some geographical context, likely in a residential area of Toronto, but the numerous short segments and imprecise turns reduce my certainty about the reversed route's exact path.  The minor variations in precise distances and interpretations of "slight" turns could lead to minor deviations from the original route when reversed.
