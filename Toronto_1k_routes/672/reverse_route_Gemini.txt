Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the East York/O'Connor area.  The presence of Monastery Lane and Fairfax Crescent gives me reasonable confidence. However, the lack of other street names and the series of left turns makes me slightly less certain, particularly about the initial and final segments.  The Don Valley Parkway or the Taylor-Massey Creek ravine could be nearby landmarks, depending on the precise location.
