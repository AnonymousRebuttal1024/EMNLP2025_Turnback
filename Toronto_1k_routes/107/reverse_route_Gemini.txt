Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route involves a primarily linear progression along Mowat Avenue and then some smaller streets. The distances are plausible, and the reversal is fairly straightforward.  The street names (Mowatt Avenue, Walnut Avenue) are recognizable to me in the area. The only uncertainty is the exact placement of some of the smaller streets relative to each other, but I am confident in the general direction and flow of the reversed route.  There would be residential buildings as POIs near the route.
