Confidence: 90%

The mention of Richmond Adelaide Centre Courtyard gives a very strong anchor for this route. This area is in the heart of the financial district, so I'm highly confident in the general layout and the reversal.  The series of shorter turns suggests navigating within the downtown core, with its dense network of streets and buildings.  Landmarks in the vicinity include office towers, hotels (like the Fairmont Royal York), and potentially theaters.
