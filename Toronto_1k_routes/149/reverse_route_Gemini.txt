Confidence: 98%

Reason: The route is predominantly straight, with only a few short turns. Reversing it is very straightforward.  The inclusion of "Rideau Avenue" helps to ground the route.  The "Keep left/right" instructions are less precise, but in this context, they are unambiguous. The long straight sections make a highly accurate reversal very likely. The area is likely residential given the nature of the instructions, but I can't pinpoint the exact location.
