Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Little Italy/Trinity Bellwoods area, given the presence of Hepbourne Street. The mix of shorter and longer segments indicates a combination of residential streets and possibly a slightly larger road. I have reasonable confidence (85%) in the accuracy of the reversed directions because the route is relatively straightforward.  However, without a map, I cannot be completely sure about potential one-way street restrictions that might necessitate minor detours. Likely POIs near this route include residential homes, restaurants, cafes, and shops, especially along College Street, which is probably nearby.
