Confidence: 85%

Reason: The reversal is largely straightforward, mirroring the original directions. However, the confidence is slightly lower due to the reliance on "Keep left/right" instructions over specific street names for a significant portion of the route.  The long stretches of "Keep left" make precise reversal slightly less certain without visual confirmation. The mention of "Saint Enochs Square" provides a landmark, suggesting this is likely a somewhat planned area within Toronto, potentially with a more formal layout than some residential streets.  The lack of other street names throughout the journey reduces confidence in the ability to precisely retrace the route.
