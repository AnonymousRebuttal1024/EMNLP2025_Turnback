Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route likely starts near the intersection of Queen and Spadina and heads west towards Bathurst.  The long final stretch suggests a major artery like Queen Street West.  The numerous turns indicate smaller side streets, making precise backtracking challenging without street names.  I'm somewhat confident based on the general direction and common street patterns in that area. Potential POIs near this route might include the Fashion District, Trinity Bellwoods Park, or various businesses along Queen West.
