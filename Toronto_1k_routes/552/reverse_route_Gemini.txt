Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the west end, potentially near Dufferin Grove Park, given the mention of Dufferin Park Avenue. The combination of longer and shorter segments, along with "keep left/right" instructions suggests navigating a mix of larger roads and smaller residential streets. My confidence is around 80%. The inclusion of Dufferin Park Avenue provides a good anchor point, but the remaining directions rely on my general understanding of the street layout in that area.  Without a map, I'm not entirely sure about the presence of one-way streets or small laneways that might require adjustments to the reversed route. POIs near this route would likely include the park, residential houses, and possibly some businesses along Dufferin Street.
