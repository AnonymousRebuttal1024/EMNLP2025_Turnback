Confidence: 85%

This route seems to start near the intersection of Berkeley Street and Front Street East, and head southeast towards the Distillery District. The inclusion of Metcalfe Street, Broadcast Lane, Berkeley Street, and Nicholson Lane provides good anchoring. The long "keep right" segment likely follows a major road such as Parliament Street or Jarvis Street.  The Distillery District, with its Victorian industrial architecture, is a prominent landmark, and the area contains a mix of residential, commercial, and entertainment venues. I'm quite confident about the reversal, aided by street names.  I have made a few assumptions about the "slight" turns and "keep right."
