Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route is located in the Weston/Mount Dennis neighbourhood in the west end of Toronto. Trethewey Drive, King Georges Drive, Freeman Road and Westacres Drive are all accurate streets in that area, giving me strong anchors for the route. The mix of "keep left/right" and specific turns onto named streets suggests navigation through a residential area with some collector roads. While the named streets boost my confidence, the turns and shorter segments without specific street names introduce a degree of uncertainty. Landmarks might include residential homes, schools such as Weston Collegiate Institute, or parks like Cruickshank Park.
