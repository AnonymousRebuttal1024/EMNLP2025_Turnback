This route appears to be in the Annex neighborhood, potentially close to the University of Toronto. The combination of shorter segments and turns suggests navigating the smaller streets typical of that area.  While I lack specific street names, the overall pattern is consistent with the Annex's layout. The area is primarily residential with a mix of older homes and apartment buildings.  University of Toronto campus buildings are potential landmarks nearby.
