Reason:The route involves a number of turns and changes in direction, making the reversal slightly more complex than simpler routes. While the street names (Kenilworth and Norway Avenues) are recognizable in the Toronto context, the numerous minor turns and the precise distances involved introduce a small chance of error in the reversal process.  The area is likely a residential neighbourhood with few significant landmarks.
