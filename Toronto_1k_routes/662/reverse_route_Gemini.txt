Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route likely starts near the intersection of Eglinton Avenue West and Caledonia Road and heads generally east.  The long 660.9-meter and 602.4 meter segments suggest major roads, perhaps Eglinton Ave W and a parallel street like Rogers Road. Grey Road and Chatsworth Drive provide good landmarks. I'm quite confident about the reversal due to these longer stretches and the named streets, giving good anchor points. Possible POIs might include businesses along Eglinton, residential buildings along the route, and potentially Earlscourt Park, which is a bit south of this area.
