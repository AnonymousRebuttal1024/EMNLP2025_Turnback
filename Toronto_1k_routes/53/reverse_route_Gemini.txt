Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This reversal through the PATH network is challenging due to the many short segments and frequent turns within a confined underground space.  While the sequence of turns is reversed, the exact distances and the slight variations in turn directions are hard to guarantee with complete certainty.  The PATH is well-known, and the overall route makes sense, but the short, complex segments make perfect reversal difficult.  There are no above-ground landmarks associated with this underground route.
