Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be located in the Earlscourt neighbourhood, just south of St. Clair West, based on the coordinates and mention of Boon Avenue, Earlscourt Avenue, Morrison Avenue, Nairn Avenue, Harvie Avenue, and McRoberts Avenue. These street names act as strong landmarks, and I'm fairly familiar with the general grid layout in this area. The "keep right" instruction likely represents a slight curve or bend.  I'm quite confident in the accuracy of the reversed route, as it appears to follow a logical and consistent path within the street grid. Earlscourt Park would be a likely POI near this route.
