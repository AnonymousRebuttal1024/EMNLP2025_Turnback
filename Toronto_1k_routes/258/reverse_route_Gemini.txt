Cloverdale Road and Old Weston Road give me strong anchors, and the many turns, though creating complexity, help define the route clearly.  This is in the west end/Junction area, and likely mixed residential and commercial based on the presence of Old Weston Road.  Potential landmarks could include businesses along Old Weston Road, or perhaps a nearby park.
