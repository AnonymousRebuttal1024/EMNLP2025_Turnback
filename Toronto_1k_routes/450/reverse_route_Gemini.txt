Confidence: 85%

"Colborne Street" helps to place this route in the downtown core, near the St. Lawrence Market area.  The very long 1217.3-meter segment likely represents a major east-west artery like Front Street or King Street. The shorter segments and "keep left/right" instructions suggest navigating smaller streets, and potentially some curves or lane changes on the larger road. The St. Lawrence Market is a major landmark in the vicinity, as are the various businesses and attractions in the historic Old Town area. I'm fairly confident in the reversal due to the street name and general road structure in that area, although the many short initial turns have some margin for error without visual context.
