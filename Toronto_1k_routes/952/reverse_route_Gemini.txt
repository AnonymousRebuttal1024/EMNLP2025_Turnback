Reasoning: This route is in the Annex neighborhood, just west of the University of Toronto campus. Lourdes Lane and Wellesley Place, combined with the coordinates, help pinpoint the start.  The relatively few turns and the generally grid-like structure of this area make reversing the directions straightforward. Potential landmarks could include University of Toronto buildings, residential homes, and possibly some of the shops and restaurants along Bloor Street West.
