Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the Upper Beaches neighborhood, east of Victoria Park Avenue.  The inclusion of Belleville Street helps to anchor the location.  The longer stretches suggest navigating along major streets like Kingston Road or Queen Street East, interspersed with shorter turns onto residential streets.  I'm reasonably confident about the reversal, especially with Belleville Street included, but the lack of other street names and the "sharp right/left" interpretations (translated to "slight left" assuming gentler turns) add some uncertainty. Potential landmarks could include residential buildings, small businesses along the main thoroughfares, and possibly some parks closer to Lake Ontario.
