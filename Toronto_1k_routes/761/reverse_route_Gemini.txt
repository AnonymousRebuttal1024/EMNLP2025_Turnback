Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Rockcliffe-Smythe neighborhood, near the intersection of St. Clair Avenue West and Runnymede Road.  Alentejo Street, Turnberry Avenue, Pryor Avenue, and Silverthorn Avenue help to place the location. The "keep right" instructions suggest curved sections of road, possibly near the Black Creek ravine system.  The lack of street names for some turns and the several shorter segments introduce a degree of uncertainty. Potential landmarks/POIs might include the Smythe Park or the ravine system itself.
