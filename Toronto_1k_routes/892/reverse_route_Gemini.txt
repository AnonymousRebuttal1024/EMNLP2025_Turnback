Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the York area, north of Eglinton West and likely west of Caledonia Road, based on the coordinates and the relatively short distances. I'm reasonably familiar with the main streets in that region. Lauder and Genessee Avenues suggest residential streets.  The simplicity of the route, with only a few turns, increases my confidence. POIs might include residential buildings, local shops, and potentially a nearby park or school.
