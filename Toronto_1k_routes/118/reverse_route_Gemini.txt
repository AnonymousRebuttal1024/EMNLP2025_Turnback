Confidence: 98%

Reason: The route is a relatively simple series of turns through what seems to be a residential area. The distances are plausible, and the reversal is straightforward, following the turns in reverse order.  The high confidence stems from the simplicity and straightforward nature of the route. I do not have specific street names to place this with accuracy in Toronto's GIS but the instructions are very clear and easily reversed.  The area would be primarily residential, with houses as the main POIs.
