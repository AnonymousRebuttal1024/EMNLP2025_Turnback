Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the Mimico neighbourhood of southwest Toronto, starting very close to Lake Ontario and heading slightly inland (north initially). Allen Avenue and Alexander Street are decent locators in the area, and the 436.2-meter section suggests a longer road, possibly Mimico Avenue or Lakeshore Blvd West. The initial short segment and turn likely involve navigating a small street or driveway very close to the lake. I'm fairly confident because of the named streets, but the "slight left" instruction adds a small element of uncertainty.  POIs might include Humber Bay Park East, or businesses along Lakeshore Blvd West.
