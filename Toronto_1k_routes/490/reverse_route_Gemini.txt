Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in a residential area, possibly with some winding streets and perhaps near a park or a larger open area. Wynford Heights Crescent is a helpful landmark, and the long straight segment of 884.5 meters likely follows a main road. I'm quite confident about the segment along Wynford Heights Crescent, but the other shorter, unnamed segments could involve some slight deviations. This area is likely near Don Mills and Eglinton, given the presence of Wynford Heights Crescent.
