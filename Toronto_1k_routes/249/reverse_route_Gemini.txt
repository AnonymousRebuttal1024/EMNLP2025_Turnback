Confidence: 90%

The long straight stretch of 1057.6 meters strongly suggests a major arterial road, likely Gardiner Expressway or Lake Shore Blvd W.  This makes the overall reversal quite straightforward.  The slight right turns introduce minor uncertainty but are unlikely to cause significant navigational problems. The beginning and end of the route are near the western edge of downtown, near the Exhibition Place area.
