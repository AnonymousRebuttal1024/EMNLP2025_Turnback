Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route follows Victoria Park Avenue, a major road in Toronto, making the directions relatively easy to reverse.  The distances seem plausible for this type of road. However, my confidence is slightly reduced because I don't have a precise mental map of all the smaller side streets and their relation to Victoria Park Avenue in this specific area, although I know that that road has a long and relatively straight path. Close to this route would be residential areas and potentially some commercial businesses along Victoria Park Avenue.
