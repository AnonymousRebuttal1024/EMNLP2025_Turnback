Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: This route is in the Cabbagetown neighborhood of Toronto, east of the downtown core. The inclusion of Sackville Street, Sumach Street, and Oak Street significantly increases my confidence, as these are all real streets in Cabbagetown.  The route seems to navigate a relatively straightforward path through this historic residential area. I'm very confident about the reversal, given the clear street names and the relatively simple pattern of turns.  Potential POIs near this route could include Riverdale Farm, the shops and restaurants along Parliament Street, or the residential architecture of Cabbagetown.
