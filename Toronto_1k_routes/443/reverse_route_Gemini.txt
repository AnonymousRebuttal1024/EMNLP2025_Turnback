Confidence: 85%

The presence of Pape Avenue, Parkfield Avenue and Billings Avenue provides strong location information. This route is in the Greektown/Danforth area, east of the Don Valley, a predominantly residential area with commercial businesses along the Danforth.  The combination of longer and shorter segments, "keep left/right" instructions, suggests a mix of navigating larger roads and smaller residential streets. I have fairly high confidence in the reversal accuracy due to the street names, though the complexity and number of turns introduce some possibility of minor deviations on the ground.  Withrow Park is a potential nearby landmark.
