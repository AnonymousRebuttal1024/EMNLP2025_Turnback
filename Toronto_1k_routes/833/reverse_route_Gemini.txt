Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: Dawes Road, Westbourne Avenue, and Moreau Trail Run provide solid reference points, increasing my confidence in the reversal. The "keep left" instructions likely indicate staying on the same road at gentle curves or forks. The route seems to involve a mix of residential streets and possibly a trail (Moreau Trail Run), which makes the area somewhat more identifiable. Potential POIs could include residential houses, Dawes Road shops and businesses, and possibly a park or ravine area connected to the trail.  I believe this is in the east end of Toronto, possibly near East York, based on my familiarity with the city's geography.
