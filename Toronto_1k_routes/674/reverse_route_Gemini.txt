Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the Kensington Market area, given the street names like Augusta Avenue, Nassau Street, Robert Street, and Russell Street.  The many short segments and turns are characteristic of the dense, somewhat irregular street layout in that neighbourhood. I have decent confidence due to the street names, but the complexity of the route makes it slightly less certain, especially without visual confirmation. Kensington Market itself and its variety of shops and restaurants would be a prominent landmark.
