Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route consists of a long, mostly straight section with a few turns. The distances seem plausible for Toronto’s street network.  The reversal is straightforward.  However, the lack of street names reduces confidence slightly; without them it is difficult to be totally sure of the precise location and layout of the route within Toronto’s larger road network. No POIs are readily identifiable without more details.
