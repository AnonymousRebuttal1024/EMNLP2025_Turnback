This route appears to be near Exhibition Place, possibly in the Liberty Village or King West Village area.  Temple Avenue and Tyndall Avenue exist in that area, supporting this location hypothesis. The route involves mostly longer, straighter segments, which aligns with the more modern street grid in these neighborhoods.  The "Keep Right" instructions suggest some highway on/off ramps or potentially navigating around a larger building or park-like area within Exhibition Place.
