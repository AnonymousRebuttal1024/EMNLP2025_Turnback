Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route is fairly complex with a number of turns, suggesting it's in a residential area, possibly near a park given the relatively short segments. Curzon Street, Peyton Lane, and Sproat Avenue are useful landmarks, possibly placing this near Trinity Bellwoods Park, though I'm not entirely sure. The "Keep right" and "slight right" instructions add uncertainty. While I'm fairly confident about the longer segments, the many short unnamed turns make it hard to be certain without a visual map.
