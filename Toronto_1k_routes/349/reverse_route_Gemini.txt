Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route is located in the Swansea/High Park neighbourhood, clearly indicated by Wright Avenue and Indian Road, both running parallel to the Lake Ontario shoreline and south of High Park itself. The initial long stretch along Wright Avenue and then the connection to Indian Road gives me strong confidence. The short turns are likely minor adjustments or lane changes.  Potential POIs include the houses and residential areas along these streets, and the proximity to High Park and the lake makes it a desirable location.
