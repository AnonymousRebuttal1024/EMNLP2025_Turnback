Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route involves several turns and some "keep right/left" instructions, which makes precise reversal slightly challenging. While the street names are clear,  the many short segments could lead to minor errors in the reversed instructions. The area is likely residential, possibly near some industrial areas given the presence of Sterling Road.  I've assumed the route stays on the same side of Sterling Road.
