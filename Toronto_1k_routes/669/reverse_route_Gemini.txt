Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the High Park North neighbourhood, based on the mentioned street names (Hanley, Priscilla, St. John's Road, Willard). I have high confidence due to these names. The route likely goes through residential streets, perhaps near the eastern edge of High Park. St. John's Road is a significant local landmark in this area.
