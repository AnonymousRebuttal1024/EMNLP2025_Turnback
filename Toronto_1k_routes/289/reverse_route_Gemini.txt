Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route likely starts near the intersection of Victoria Park Avenue and Lawrence Avenue East in Scarborough.  The initial west and then right turn likely puts the route onto Lawrence Avenue East. The subsequent left turn could be onto a residential street north or south of Lawrence.  The longer stretches suggest less complex navigation than the previous examples, but the lack of specific street names makes it harder to confirm the exact path. Some minor adjustments might be needed. Potential POIs might include various businesses along Lawrence Avenue East and residential buildings. I reduced the confidence a bit because the lack of street names makes pinpoint accuracy difficult.
