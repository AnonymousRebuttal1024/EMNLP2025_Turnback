Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: Briar Hill Avenue and Blythwood Ravine Trail provide good landmarks, especially the ravine trail.  The route is fairly straightforward with a limited number of turns, increasing my confidence in reversing it. The "keep right" instruction likely refers to staying on the main path. Potential POIs include residential buildings along Briar Hill Avenue and Blythwood Ravine Park itself. The presence of a ravine trail suggests a more natural setting. Based on my knowledge of Toronto, this is likely in the north-central area, possibly near the intersection of Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue, as that area features ravines.
