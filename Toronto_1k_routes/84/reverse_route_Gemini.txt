Confidence: 98%

Reason: The route involves streets I recognize in Toronto (Moutray Street, Brock Avenue, St. Clarens Avenue) and the sequence of turns and distances is plausible for a residential area.  The reversal is straightforward.  The area is residential, with likely houses and small businesses as POIs near the route.  The high confidence comes from familiarity with these streets and a plausible route structure.
