"Lankin Boulevard" helps place this route just north of the Danforth, east of the Don Valley.  The numerous "keep left" instructions suggest following a curving road or potentially navigating a series of traffic circles or roundabouts.  The 193.3-meter and 174.0-meter segments likely represent stretches along slightly larger roads, while Lankin Boulevard itself appears to be a shorter residential street.  I have reasonably high confidence in the reversal due to the named street, but the curving nature of the route introduces some uncertainty without a visual map.  No immediately obvious major landmarks come to mind based on this information.
