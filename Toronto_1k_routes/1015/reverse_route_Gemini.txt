Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: This route is in the Cedarvale/Forest Hill neighborhood of Toronto.  I'm very confident because of the specific street names provided.  Winona Drive, Bude Street, Alameda Avenue, Vaughan Road, Kirknewton Road, Ennerdale Road, Branstone Road, Thornton Avenue, Nairn Avenue, and Carrington Avenue are all real streets in that area and their relative positions are consistent with my understanding of the neighborhood.  Vaughan Road is a major north-south artery in this area, which helps anchor the route. The "Lane South Eglington East Ennerdale" likely refers to a small laneway south of Eglinton Avenue and east of Ennerdale, which is common in this area.  Possible POIs near this route could include Cedarvale Park, Forest Hill Village shops, and Eglinton West subway station.
