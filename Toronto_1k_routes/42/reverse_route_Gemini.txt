Confidence: 98%

Reasoning: The reversal is highly confident due to the relatively straightforward and sequential nature of the turns.  The street names are clearly identifiable, and their relative positions are accurately reflected in the reversed directions. Minor uncertainty arises from the precise measurements of shorter segments and the "slight" turn, but overall route integrity is very strong. The area is residential, near the Don Valley, and there aren't any major landmarks directly on the route.
