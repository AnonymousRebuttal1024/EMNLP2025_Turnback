Explanation: The path relies on a combination of urban streets and trails like Main Street and the Taylor Creek Hydro Corridor Trail, typically prevalent within Torontoâ€™s east-end neighborhoods bordering East York and Scarborough. By attentively reversing the instructions through a modular sequence, each step impacts the retrace efficiency aided by organized spatial alignments common in these sectors. This technique balances the integrity of rotational directions following geographical orientation continuity supportive of consistent reversals.
