Confidence: 92%

Reason: This route is moderately complex with several turns and street segments, making the reversal slightly more challenging. While the street names are somewhat recognizable, the specifics (especially the smaller streets) are less certain than in simpler routes. The numerous minor turns and the precise distances involved introduce a small chance of error in the reversal process. The area is likely a residential neighbourhood with few significant landmarks.
