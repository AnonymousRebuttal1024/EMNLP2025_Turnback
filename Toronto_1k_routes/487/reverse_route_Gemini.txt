Confidence: 85%

Reasoning:  This route appears to navigate a residential area, possibly with some curves and potentially near a park given the relatively short segments and the presence of Blossomfield Drive. The "keep left" could indicate a slight curve or fork in the road. I'm fairly confident in the reversal, especially with Blossomfield Drive as an anchor, but minor adjustments could be needed on the ground. I'd guess this area to be north of Yorkdale Shopping Centre based on street name but I'm not entirely sure.
