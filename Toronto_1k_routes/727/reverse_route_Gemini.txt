Confidence: 65%

Reasoning:  This route is very complex, with a very high number of turns.  It seems to be in the east end, possibly Leslieville/Riverdale, judging by street names like Pape, Badgerow, Booth, and Logan.  These named streets provide anchor points, but the many short, unnamed segments make it difficult to trace precisely from memory. I'm assuming a fairly regular grid pattern in some parts, which might not be accurate.  The sheer number of steps lowers my confidence considerably. Potential POIs could include Jimmie Simpson Park, if the location is close, or perhaps Queen Street East.
