Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route seems to be mainly in a residential area, based on the turns and distances. Benlamond Avenue and Norwood Road being mentioned as named roads helps to anchor the route. The "keep left/right" instructions introduce a bit of uncertainty, as these could represent curves rather than sharp turns.  The distances suggest this area is likely east of the Don Valley Parkway and south of Danforth Avenue, given its proximity to those two features, which are major landmarks in Toronto. I'm fairly confident in the reversal because of the road names, and the relatively straightforward turns.  I'd reduce it slightly as I don't know the exact shape of the keep left/right turns.
