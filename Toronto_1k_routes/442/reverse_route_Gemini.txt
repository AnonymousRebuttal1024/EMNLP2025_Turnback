Confidence: 85%

The relatively long, straight segment of 757.4 meters likely represents a major east-west arterial road, possibly Lake Shore Blvd E or Eastern Avenue, given the coordinates which place this route in the Leslieville/Riverside area. The subsequent "keep right" instructions suggest curves or slight bends in the road.  The final turns and shorter segments likely represent navigation on smaller residential streets. The lack of specific street names introduces some uncertainty, but the general direction and major road segment provide a good anchor for the reversal.  The area is likely a mix of residential and commercial properties.  No specific landmarks can be determined with certainty.
