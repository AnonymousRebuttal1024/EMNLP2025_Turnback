Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the Corso Italia neighbourhood, near Earlscourt Park.  Ascot Avenue, Earlscourt Avenue, St. Clarens Avenue, and Brandon Avenue are all streets in this residential area. The many turns and relatively short distances suggest a winding path through the neighbourhood.  The lack of clearly identifiable longer roads, and the sheer number of steps, make it difficult to reconstruct precisely in my mind, hence the lower confidence level. POIs might include Earlscourt Park or residential buildings.
