Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: My confidence is 80% because the route includes several named streets (Brandon Avenue, Franklin Avenue, Edwin Avenue), which helps in reversing the directions. However, the presence of many short segments and turns, especially in the latter half, introduces some uncertainty.  While the reversal of turns is relatively straightforward, the precise distances and exact positions of intersections without a visual map might cause minor discrepancies. The lack of knowledge about the broader neighborhood around the route slightly lowers my confidence.
