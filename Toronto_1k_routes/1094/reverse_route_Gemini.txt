Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: The presence of Avonlea Boulevard, Dentonia Park Avenue, Thyra Avenue and Maybourne Avenue gives me good confidence. This route is in the Danforth and Victoria Park area, near Dentonia Park golf course. These street names, particularly the initial and final ones, provide reliable reference points.  While there are some turns without street names, the context and general distances allow for a fairly accurate reversal.  Potential POIs near this route include Dentonia Park Golf Course, Taylor Creek Park, and the shops and restaurants along Danforth Avenue.
