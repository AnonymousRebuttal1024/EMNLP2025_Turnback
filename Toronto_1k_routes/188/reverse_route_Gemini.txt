Reason: The route involves a series of turns and street segments, and while the street names are somewhat recognizable, the specifics are less certain.  The presence of "Bank of Montreal drive thru" suggests a commercial area, but the overall route is less familiar than some others, leading to a slightly lower confidence level.  There are likely some residential areas and possibly a small plaza or shopping centre nearby.
