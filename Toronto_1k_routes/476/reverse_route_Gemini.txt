Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route seems to be a short walk probably in a residential area, based on the short distances and turns. Doncaster Avenue is a key landmark.  The initial and final legs are short and east/west oriented, and the middle section involves a longer north/south leg along Doncaster, with some minor adjustments.  I'm fairly confident in the reverse directions, as the turns are relatively unambiguous. The area is likely near Danforth Village, given the proximity to Doncaster Ave.
