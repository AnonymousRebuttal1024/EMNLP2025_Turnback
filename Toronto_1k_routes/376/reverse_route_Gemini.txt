Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route seems to begin in the Mimico neighbourhood of south Etobicoke, near the lake. Alberta Circle and Alma Avenue help to pinpoint the location.  The longer segments suggest travelling along main roads, possibly Lake Shore Blvd W or Royal York Road. The absence of street names for most turns introduces some uncertainty, particularly with the "Keep Left/Right" instructions, as these can be related to forks or highway exits that might be hard to reverse without a visual. Potential POIs include residential homes closer to the lake, Humber Bay Park East (further to the north-east), and businesses along Lake Shore Blvd W.
