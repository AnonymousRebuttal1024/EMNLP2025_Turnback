**Confidence: 85%**

**Reason:** While the path reversal maintains logical consistency, my confidence is slightly reduced due to urban complexity and potential variance in the interpretation of "keeping left/right" particularly over extended distances. The minor paths along the way which might include shortcuts or connecting walkways typical in urban areas but details were directly reversed from given data, hence fewer potential discrepancies remain.
