The lack of street names makes this a bit tricky.  The "slight left/right" and "keep left/right" instructions introduce uncertainty about the exact angles. However, the relatively few turns and the varying distances provide a reasonable framework for reversal.  This area is in the western part of Etobicoke, and I'm less certain about specific landmarks without street names. It's likely residential based on the coordinates.
