Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Casa Loma neighborhood, likely starting near Spadina Road and heading west towards Bathurst Street. The presence of Alcina Avenue, Wychwood Avenue, and Turner Road provides solid anchoring points for the location. This area features a mix of residential properties and some commercial establishments along St. Clair Avenue West.  I'm quite confident in the reversal, particularly because of the street names. I have interpreted "sharp left" as "slight right" and made a few assumptions with the "keep left/right" instructions.  Potential landmarks in this area might include Casa Loma itself, Sir Winston Churchill Park, and the Spadina Museum.
