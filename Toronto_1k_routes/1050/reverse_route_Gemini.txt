Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in East York, likely near Woodbine and Danforth Avenues. The inclusion of Woodfield Road and Rhodes Avenue provides strong anchors and increases my confidence.  The route involves many turns and short segments, which suggests navigating residential streets and potentially some smaller parks or green spaces. I'm confident about the reversal of the longer segments, but the multiple "slight" and "keep" instructions introduce some uncertainty regarding precise angles and curves, especially when reversing the route.  Potential POIs near this area could include shops and restaurants along the Danforth, parks along the Don River, or residential areas in East York.
