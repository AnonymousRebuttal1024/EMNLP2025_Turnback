Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Junction Triangle, near the West Toronto Railpath. The inclusion of Ward Street, Wallace Avenue, the West Toronto Railpath, Glenlake Avenue, and Dorval Road helps locate and follow the route confidently.  This area is a mix of residential and industrial/commercial spaces, and the Railpath itself is a notable landmark. The many short segments and frequent turns suggest navigating a combination of streets and potentially the paths along the Railpath. I'm quite confident in the reversal due to the named streets and the Railpath, but the several "slight" turns and "keep right" instructions introduce minor uncertainty without a visual reference.
