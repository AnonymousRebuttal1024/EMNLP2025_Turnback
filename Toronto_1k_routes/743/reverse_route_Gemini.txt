Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the Junction Triangle, given Edwin and Franklin Avenues. Foundry Avenue further confirms this.  While these street names give good anchor points, the mix of short segments and unnamed roads makes it slightly less certain.  I have a good mental picture of the main streets in the Junction Triangle, but the exact placement of all the small residential streets is tricky. Potential landmarks could include the train tracks that run through the area or the nearby Wallace Emerson Community Centre.
