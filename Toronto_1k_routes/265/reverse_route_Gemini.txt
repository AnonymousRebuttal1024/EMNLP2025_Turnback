Triller Avenue provides a good anchor, and the detailed turns, while numerous, offer a decent structure for reversal.  The "slight left/right" instructions introduce some ambiguity.  The initial "south, continue for 0.0 meters" is unusual and might represent a very small initial movement or a correction at the start. This area is in the west end, south of High Park, in the Swansea neighbourhood.  Potential landmarks could include the shops and restaurants along Windermere Ave to the north or the residential streets of Swansea.
