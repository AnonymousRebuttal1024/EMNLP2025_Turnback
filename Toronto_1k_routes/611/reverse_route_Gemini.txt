Confidence: 80%

This route seems to run primarily west-east, likely along a major artery like Queen Street West or King Street West, towards Spadina Avenue.  The long initial "head west" suggests a significant stretch along a major road. The lack of street names makes precise location determination and landmark identification difficult. The short turns at the end suggest turning onto smaller side streets or laneways. I'm fairly confident about the general direction of the reverse route, though the precise location of the turns and the initial/final stretches are less certain.  Potential landmarks along a route like this could include various businesses, restaurants, and cultural venues depending on which street is being followed.
