Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route is moderately complex with several turns and changes in direction, but the street names and distances are relatively clear.  The mention of "PATH" suggests a pedestrian walkway, which could add minor uncertainty if the exact path within this walkway is not clearly defined.  Otherwise, reversing the turns and distances is relatively straightforward. The area is likely a mix of commercial and residential areas, potentially near the downtown core.
