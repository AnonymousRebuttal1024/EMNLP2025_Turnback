Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the Princess Anne Manor neighborhood near the Humber River, based on the street names like Culford, Queen's Drive, Gracefield, Bryn, and Wyndale.  These are characteristic of that area's winding, residential streets. The inclusion of "sharp" turns further reinforces the idea of a less grid-like street pattern. My confidence is 90% because the sequence of streets and turns makes sense for this neighborhood. However, lacking a map, I cannot completely rule out small variations that might be needed in real-world navigation. Likely POIs would include residential homes, possibly a nearby park or ravines leading down to the Humber River.
