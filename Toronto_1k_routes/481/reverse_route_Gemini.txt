Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route seems to be within a residential area or a park, possibly near a ravine, given the winding streets and names like "Green Belt Drive" and "Moccasin Trail." Dallimore Circle appearing multiple times suggests a loop or a curved street. The presence of these named streets/paths aids in understanding the route.  The final three left turns suggest a possible destination near a cul-de-sac or a dead end. I'm moderately confident in the reverse directions, but the multiple turns on Dallimore Circle could be slightly ambiguous without a visual map. This area is likely in North York, possibly near the Don Valley, though I can't be certain without more information.  I'm reducing confidence a bit because I'm making some assumptions about the layout of Dallimore Circle.
