This route appears to be near High Park, potentially south of Bloor Street West.  I'm reasonably familiar with the street grid in that area, and the lengths of the segments seem plausible.  The short segments (22.5 meters, 23.1 meters, 13.0 meters, 2.9 meters) suggest potential pedestrian shortcuts or slight deviations from the main roads.  The lack of street names makes it harder to be absolutely certain, but the general pattern fits the neighborhood.  This area is mostly residential with some parkland nearby.
