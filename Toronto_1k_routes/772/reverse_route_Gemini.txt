Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be within a residential grid, likely in the Bloor West Village/High Park North area based on the coordinates. Marmaduke Street is a key landmark that helps anchor the route.  The numerous short segments and turns likely represent navigating smaller streets, corners, and potentially laneways. I'm fairly confident in the reversal, especially with the presence of the named street. The very short segments (0.7m, 1.8m, 4.1m, 4.8m) introduce some uncertainty, as they could represent very minor adjustments in direction that might be hard to precisely retrace in reverse. High Park would be a nearby POI.
