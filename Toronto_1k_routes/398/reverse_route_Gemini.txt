Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be near the Beaches neighborhood, close to the lake.  "Martin Goodman Trail" is a strong indicator of proximity to the waterfront.  Sandycove Way and Wineva Avenue suggest residential areas. I'm reasonably confident because the trail acts as a good anchor, and the general flow of the directions seems plausible. However, without more context, the numerous short turns at the beginning and lack of other major landmarks make it difficult to be entirely certain. Potential POIs include beaches along Lake Ontario, and the Martin Goodman Trail itself.
