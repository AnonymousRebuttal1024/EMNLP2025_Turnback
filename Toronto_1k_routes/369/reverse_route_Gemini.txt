Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the Corktown neighbourhood, east of downtown.  Peggy Ann Smith Lane, Kintyre Avenue, Hamilton Street, Thompson Street, Graham Place, and Morse Street are all located in this area. The many turns reflect Corktown's mix of smaller residential streets and the remnants of its industrial past. While the named streets provide good anchors, the numerous short, unnamed segments introduce significant uncertainty.  These could represent alleys, parking lot entrances, or small pedestrian pathways that are very difficult to pinpoint without a detailed map.  Potential POIs include residential homes, small businesses along Queen Street East (which is likely near), and possibly some remaining industrial buildings or art studios.
