Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route clearly appears to be within the Eaton Centre shopping mall, a major landmark in downtown Toronto.  "Eaton Centre level 3" gives it away.  Although the specific shops and corridors within the mall are hard to track from memory, the general layout of the mall and the limited scope of the route inside the building provide strong confidence.  Potential nearby landmarks would include Dundas Square, Yonge-Dundas Square, and the subway stations at Dundas and Queen.
