Confidence: 85%

Reason: The route involves a series of turns through what seems to be a residential area of Toronto, including some smaller streets.  While the street names (Walmer Road, Kendal Avenue, Major Street, Ulster Street, Campbell Russell Lane, Oxford Street) are plausible for Toronto, I am less certain of the exact sequence and positioning of these smaller streets. The many turns and the numerous short segments make the reverse navigation more challenging.  Reversing the directions is logically possible but not entirely straightforward. There are likely residential buildings and possibly small local businesses in the vicinity.  The uncertainty about the exact street layout reduces confidence.
