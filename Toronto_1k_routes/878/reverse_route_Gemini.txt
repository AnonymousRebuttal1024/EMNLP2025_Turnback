Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the Etobicoke/Mimico area, likely south of Bloor St West near the Humber River based on street names like Indian Road and Radford Ave and the coordinates. However, the many turns and "keep right/left" instructions make it difficult to trace accurately in my mind.  The higher number of "keep right/left" instructions makes me less confident about the precise reversal.  Likely POIs would include residential areas, parks along the Humber River, and perhaps some smaller businesses.
