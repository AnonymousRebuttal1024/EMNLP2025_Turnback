Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the downtown core, based on the coordinates and the mention of Court Street and Frederick Street. I am familiar with this area, and these streets provide a good anchor for the route.  The "keep right" instruction likely represents a slight curve rather than a hard turn. The short initial segment on Court Square suggests the starting point might be near a building entrance or a small square. Given the relative straightforwardness of the route and the known street names, I'm quite confident in the reversed directions. Nearby POIs could include Old City Hall, Nathan Phillips Square, or Eaton Centre.
