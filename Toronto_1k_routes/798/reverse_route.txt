Explanation: The reversal utilized street names like Minto Street, Knox Avenue, and Memory Lane, regions rooted within Torontoâ€™s Leslieville or South Riverdale neighborhoods, characterized by the structured street and alley patterns integral to mid-sized residential areas. While the multiplicity of slight and sharp turns presented a complex path, the methodical directional reversals aimed for accurate spatial retracing in line with urban alignment measures known to this vicinity. The approach maintained substantial navigational integrity across intersections, contributing to consistent directional portrayal.
