Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the east end, likely near the Don Valley and Taylor Creek Park, based on the "Pocket Trail" and "Oakvale Path" names, which suggest a ravine setting. Sammon and Leroy Avenues also provide some context. However, the many unnamed turns and the mix of trails and streets make it difficult to reverse with very high confidence solely from a mental map.  Potential landmarks in this area might include the trails and green spaces along the Don Valley, though the precise location is tricky to determine.
