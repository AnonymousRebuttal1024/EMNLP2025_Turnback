Confidence: 65%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Upper Beaches/East Danforth area, likely near the Danforth GO/TTC station based on the mention of Jackman Avenue and the number of turns.  Thomas McClintock Lane exists in that area. I'm reasonably confident in the initial and final segments due to the street names provided, but the many turns in between make precise reconstruction difficult without a visual map. I have less confidence in the exact angles (slight/sharp) of turns and the presence of small lanes or alleys.  Potential landmarks could include residential homes, shops along Danforth Avenue, or possibly the TTC station itself.
