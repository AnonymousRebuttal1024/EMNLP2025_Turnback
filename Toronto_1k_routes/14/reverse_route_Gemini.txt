Confidence: 95%

Explanation: This route is in the Junction Triangle area. The inclusion of Boon Avenue and Rosemount Avenue, and the relatively short and straightforward nature of the directions, makes me quite confident in the reverse route. The area is largely residential, with smaller streets like Rosemount connecting to larger arteries like Boon. Potential POIs near this route include the businesses along Dundas Street West and the residential areas surrounding the former railway lands.
