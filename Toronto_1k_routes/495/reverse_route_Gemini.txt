Reasoning: This route is relatively short and simple, with Alexander Muir Road serving as a clear landmark.  The initial and final legs are roughly southeast/northwest, consistent with the small change in latitude and longitude. The "keep left" and "slight left" instructions suggest a gentle curve rather than a sharp turn. The area is likely near Avenue Road and Lawrence, a fairly residential area. The limited number of turns and the presence of the named road give me high confidence in the reversed directions.
