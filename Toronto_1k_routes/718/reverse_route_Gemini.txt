Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: I'm familiar with the general area of Donlands and Memorial Park, these are well-known streets in the east end of Toronto.  I'm pretty sure about the reversal involving these roads. The unnamed road at the destination makes me slightly less confident, as small residential streets can be harder to place precisely in a mental map.  Likely POIs near this route could include the Don Valley Parkway, the Pape subway station, and Withrow Park.
