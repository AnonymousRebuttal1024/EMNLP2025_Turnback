Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be in a primarily residential area, possibly near Bayview Avenue and Blythwood Ravine, based on the presence of Hargrave Lane which I believe is in that vicinity. The inclusion of a lane suggests a quieter, possibly more secluded area. I have reasonably high confidence (85%) in the reversal, as the steps are fairly straightforward. However, without a map, I can't be completely certain about the presence of any dead ends or private roads that might necessitate a slightly different route in reality. Likely POIs in this area would include residential homes and potentially the ravine itself or a nearby park.
