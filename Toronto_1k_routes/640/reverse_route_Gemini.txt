Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the Leslieville/Riverdale area, east of downtown. Gough Avenue, Harcourt Avenue, Carlaw Avenue, and McConnell Avenue are good landmarks. The starting point appears to be south of Queen Street East, and the route heads roughly north. The longer 365.5m segment could be along Carlaw Avenue or a similar north-south street.  The numerous short segments and turns make it tricky to reconstruct mentally without a map, lowering my confidence somewhat. Potential POIs could include Jimmie Simpson Park if the route passes close to it, or various businesses along Queen Street East.
