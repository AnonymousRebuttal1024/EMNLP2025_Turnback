Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route seems to be in East York, likely east of Victoria Park Avenue and potentially near Dawes Road based on the coordinates and the mention of Victoria Park Ave, Balsam Avenue, Pine Glen Road and Glen Manor Drive East. These street names suggest a residential area.  However, the numerous turns and "keep right/left" instructions make it harder to mentally reconstruct the exact path, thus lowering my confidence. Potential POIs might include residential buildings, local businesses along Victoria Park, and potentially a nearby park or school.
