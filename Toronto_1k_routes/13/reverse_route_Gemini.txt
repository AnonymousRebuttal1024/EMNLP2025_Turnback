Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route is in the heart of downtown Toronto, starting near the Entertainment District and ending near the Financial District.  The mention of Richmond Adelaide Centre Courtyard provides a solid anchor point. The numerous turns likely involve navigating smaller streets within the downtown core, which can be complex. My confidence is high due to the known destination and the general west-to-east trajectory, but the lack of street names for much of the route makes it challenging to be completely certain. Potential POIs along or near this route would definitely include the Richmond Adelaide Centre, possibly Roy Thomson Hall, the CN Tower, and numerous office towers and restaurants.
