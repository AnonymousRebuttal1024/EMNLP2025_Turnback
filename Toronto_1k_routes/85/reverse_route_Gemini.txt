Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route is a simple sequence of turns along streets in what seems to be a residential area of Toronto.  The street names (Shaw Street, Marchmount Road, Delaware Avenue North) are plausible, although not highly distinctive.  The distances are reasonable for city blocks.  The reversal is straightforward, following the turns in reverse order. Nearby POIs are likely residential buildings. My confidence is slightly lower because I am unsure of the exact layout of this specific residential area but I feel it has a decent chance of being accurate.
