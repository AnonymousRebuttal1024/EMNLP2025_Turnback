Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in an industrial/commercial area near Warden and Eglinton, given the coordinates and the presence of Ashtonbee Road and Thermos Road. Knowing these streets gives me a good anchor. However, several short, unnamed segments make the precise path harder to visualize and reverse. There are also a couple of "keep left" instructions that could represent slight bends or curves, adding a bit of ambiguity.  Potential POIs near this route could include industrial buildings or businesses along Warden Avenue.
