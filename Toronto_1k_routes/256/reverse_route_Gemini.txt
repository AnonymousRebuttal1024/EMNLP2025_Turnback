Confidence: 90%

The multiple street and pathway names (Summerhill Path, Summerhill Avenue, Summerhill Gardens, Mathersfield Drive, Cluny Drive) provide strong anchors, boosting my confidence. The turns are well-described, although "slight left" and "keep right/left" introduce some minor ambiguity. This route appears to navigate a primarily residential area with potentially some parkland, given the presence of "Path" in the name. This is in the affluent Rosedale neighbourhood, near the Rosedale Ravine Lands. Potential landmarks could include Rosedale Park, or the upscale homes in the area.
