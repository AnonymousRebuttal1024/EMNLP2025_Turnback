Confidence: 93%

Reason: The route is fairly detailed with several street names (Huron Street, Gwen Egan Lane, Bernard Avenue, Madison Avenue), providing reasonable geographical context within a likely residential area of Toronto.  The reversal is straightforward, though the several turns and shorter distances introduce a small amount of uncertainty in the perfect replication of the route in real life.  The numerous short sections make it slightly less certain than a longer route along larger streets.
