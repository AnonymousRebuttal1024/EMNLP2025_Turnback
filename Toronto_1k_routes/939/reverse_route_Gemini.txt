Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route is in the Forest Hill South neighborhood, near Eglinton West and Bathurst Street.  The street names, Kincort, Strathnairn, Glenhaven, Yore Road, Richardson, Lester, Eglinton West, and Scott Road, are all real and help to establish the route with reasonable accuracy.  The high number of turns makes it a bit more complex, but the known street names boost my confidence.  I am less sure about some of the shorter segments between turns and precise turn angles, especially the "sharp left".  Landmarks near this route would definitely include residential buildings and potentially a local park or school.
