**Confidence: 85%**

**Reason:** The navigation involves numerous turns and transitions between minor and significant roads, necessitating precise reversals. Named streets like Dunkirk Road, Queensdale Avenue, and Monarch Park Avenue help ensure correct reversals in key segments. The navigation complexity increases with sharp turns and alternating left/right keep directions, posing potential challenges to perfect reversals. Urban variability and slight turns add marginal uncertainty, although the overall sequence is supported by structured directionality and linear flow.
