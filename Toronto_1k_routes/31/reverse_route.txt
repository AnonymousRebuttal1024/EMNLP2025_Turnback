**Confidence: 90%**

**Reason:** The route includes distinct street names such as Cumberland Street, Yonge Street, and Devonshire Place, which ensure that the path can be accurately retraced. The structured sequence of direction changes, paired with the careful inversion of distances and turns, supports a logical and mostly reliable navigation back along the original route. High confidence is achieved through attention to detail in reversing intricate paths and verified step descriptions within the urban context, modulated slightly by typical city variability.
