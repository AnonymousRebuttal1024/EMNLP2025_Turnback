This route appears to start near Queen Street West and Dovercourt Road, and head generally northwest towards Dufferin Street.  The inclusion of Joe Shuster Way, Peel Avenue, Gladstone Avenue, Antonio Lopes Lane, Cross Street, Beaconsfield Avenue, Mackenzie Crescent, Lisgar Street, and Dovercourt Road significantly improves confidence in accurately reconstructing the reverse route. These are all real streets in the area. Joe Shuster Way is a small pedestrian laneway named after the co-creator of Superman, reflecting the area's character. This route travels through a mix of residential and commercial areas, particularly near Queen West.  Potential landmarks include Trinity Bellwoods Park (if it extends that far south) and the various shops and restaurants along Queen Street West. "Sharp left" has been translated to "slight right," assuming a less than 180-degree turn.
