Confidence: 95%

This is a very short route, likely within a single block. The turns suggest a rectangular or near-rectangular path.  My confidence is high because reversing such a simple route is straightforward.  It's difficult to pinpoint the precise location without more context, but given the coordinates, it's likely in North York, potentially in a residential neighborhood.
