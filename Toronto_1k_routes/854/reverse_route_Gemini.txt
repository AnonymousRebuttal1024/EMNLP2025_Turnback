Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: Frater Avenue, Binswood Avenue, Sammon Avenue, Woodington Avenue, and Springdale Boulevard offer a good series of landmarks, especially in a residential area like this likely is. This gives me high confidence in the accuracy of the reversed directions.  Potential POIs likely include residential homes and potentially a small park or school. The location is probably in the east end, perhaps near the Don Valley or Taylor Creek Park, based on my knowledge of Toronto's street names and layout.
