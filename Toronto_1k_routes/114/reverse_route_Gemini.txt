Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route involves a major street (Bicknell Avenue) and a smaller street (Municipal Drive), both plausible names for Toronto. The distances are reasonable. While the reversal is straightforward, the lack of other street names and the presence of several short turns reduce confidence slightly, as the precise relative positions of some smaller streets are uncertain without a map.  Bicknell Avenue is likely to have residential buildings and possibly some small businesses along it.
