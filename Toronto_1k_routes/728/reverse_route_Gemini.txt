Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is relatively simple, involving only a few turns. The presence of Rustic Road at the start provides a good anchor point, and the subsequent long stretch followed by a left turn makes the reversal straightforward.  This area is likely near York University, and I'm quite familiar with the major roads in that area. Potential landmarks might include the York University campus or Black Creek Pioneer Village.  I'm highly confident due to the simplicity of the route and familiarity with the general area.
