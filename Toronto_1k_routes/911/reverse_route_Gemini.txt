Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the Fashion District/Entertainment District, based on the coordinates and the mention of Portland Street and Dan Leckie Way.  I'm reasonably familiar with this area, which is known for its mix of condos, entertainment venues, and businesses.  However, the many turns, including a "slight right," and the mix of short and longer segments make mentally reconstructing the precise path difficult, thus reducing my confidence. POIs might include the TIFF Bell Lightbox, various restaurants and clubs, and potentially the Princess of Wales Theatre.  Being in a dense urban area with a relatively complex route introduces a higher chance of error in the reversal.
