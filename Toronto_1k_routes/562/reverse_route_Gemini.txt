Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be near Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue, based on the mention of Duplex Avenue and Maxwell Avenue which are in that area.  The route is fairly short and involves a few main turns, suggesting a relatively straightforward path within a residential neighborhood. I have high confidence (90%) due to the clear street names and the simplicity of the route.  However, lacking a map, I can't be 100% certain about minor details, like the exact placement of Maxwell Avenue relative to Duplex. Potential POIs include residential buildings, and businesses along Yonge Street or St. Clair.
