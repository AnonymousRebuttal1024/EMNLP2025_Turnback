Confidence: 90%

Explanation: The journey seems to chart a path through midtown Toronto, likely navigating around Lawrence Park or the Lytton Park neighborhoods, characterized by residential areas with tree-lined streets and community parks. The path leverages key avenues and involves a roundabout, indicating careful directional tracking to preserve the pathway's integrity when reversing. The complexity added by the roundabout navigation and the associated turns contributes to a high confidence level, assuming correct interpretation of urban intersections and standard midtown Toronto navigation patterns.
