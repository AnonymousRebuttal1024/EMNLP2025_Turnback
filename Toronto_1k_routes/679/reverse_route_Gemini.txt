Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be within High Park, starting near Colborne Lodge Drive and ending near Spring Road.  The inclusion of "Nature Trail" suggests it goes through park paths. The multiple turns suggest a winding route, which is typical for park trails.  I'm reasonably confident about the Colborne Lodge Drive and Spring Road portions but less so about the exact turns within the park itself as trails can be less defined than roads.  Grenadier Pond, High Park Zoo, and various gardens are potential nearby landmarks within the park.
