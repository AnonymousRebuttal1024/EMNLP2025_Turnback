Confidence: 90%

Reasoning:  This route is relatively simple, dominated by a long stretch along Gladstone Avenue, which serves as a clear landmark. This is likely in the west end, possibly near Parkdale or just north of it, given Gladstone's location. The initial southwest heading and the final northeast heading are consistent with the coordinate changes. The shorter segments at the beginning and end are likely smaller streets or driveways.  The "keep left" instruction introduces minor uncertainty, but the overall simplicity of the route gives me high confidence.
