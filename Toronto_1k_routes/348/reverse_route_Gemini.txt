Confidence: 85%

Explanation: Andy Olvet Lane is a very distinct street name, giving me high confidence in the core part of this route.  This area is in the Upper Beaches, near the Beaches International Jazz Festival grounds. The other turns likely represent smaller residential streets, which are typical of the area.  Potential POIs include residential homes, possibly Kew Gardens, and businesses along Queen Street East, which is likely nearby.
