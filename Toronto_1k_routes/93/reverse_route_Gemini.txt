Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route is relatively simple, involving a short segment along Willard Avenue and then a longer stretch seemingly along another road (un-named in the directions).  The distances are plausible for Toronto's street network. Reversing it is straightforward.  However, the absence of the second road's name slightly reduces my confidence, as it makes it slightly harder to precisely place it within the Toronto road network.  Near this route I'd expect to find residential buildings.
