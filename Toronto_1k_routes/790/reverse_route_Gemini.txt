Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be in The Junction neighbourhood, given the coordinates and the mention of Pacific Avenue, Junction Road, and Westport Avenue. These street names are key for anchoring the route and understanding the turns.  The many short, unnamed segments suggest navigating smaller residential streets or laneways. The "keep left" instruction implies a slight curve or bend. I'm fairly confident in the reversal, thanks to the presence of the named streets, but the numerous short segments introduce some uncertainty as to their exact nature.  POIs could include the Junction Train Station, or businesses along Dundas Street West.
