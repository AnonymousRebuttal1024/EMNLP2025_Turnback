Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route likely starts near the intersection of Kane Avenue and Rogers Road in the Corso Italia neighbourhood. Kane Avenue is a significant north-south road in this area. The route then proceeds eastward towards St. Clair Avenue West. The presence of a left turn followed by a right turn onto St. Clair West suggests a possible u-turn or complex intersection. POIs near this route could include Earlscourt Park, various businesses along St. Clair West, and residential buildings.  I have high confidence because Kane Avenue and St. Clair West are clear landmarks, but there's some uncertainty about the smaller turns.
