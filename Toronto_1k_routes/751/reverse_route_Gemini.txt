Confidence: 65%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the Rosedale/Summerhill area, north of downtown Toronto.  The presence of Galbraith Road gives some grounding, but the numerous turns, many without street names, makes the precise path difficult to reconstruct mentally.  The “continue straight” instructions also add to the uncertainty, as I can't be sure what roads are being followed.  Potential landmarks might include the Rosedale ravine and the residential areas surrounding it, but without more street names, it’s hard to be more specific.
