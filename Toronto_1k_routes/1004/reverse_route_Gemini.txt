Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the neighborhood of York University Heights, west of Jane Street. Falstaff Avenue is a residential street in this area. The long 651.5-meter segment likely follows a major road such as Finch Avenue West. My confidence is decent due to the presence of Falstaff Avenue and the general structure of the route.
