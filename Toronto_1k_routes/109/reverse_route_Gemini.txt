Confidence: 70%

Reason: This route is very similar to a previous one with many turns and short segments.  The inclusion of "King Liberty Bridge" and "White Squirrel Way" (which is not a real street name and lowers confidence) further complicates the process and decreases my confidence in the accuracy of the reverse directions.  The high number of turns and short distances make it hard to visualize the route's exact layout without a map.  Because of this, despite the logical reversal, I have a low degree of certainty. There's insufficient information to identify POIs with any confidence.
