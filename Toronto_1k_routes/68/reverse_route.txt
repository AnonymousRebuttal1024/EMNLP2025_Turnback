**Confidence: 90%**

**Reason:** The path primarily involves clear directional segments with definite turns, such as on Soho Place and Soho Street, informing proper navigation. The structured directions paired with distinct transitions assist the reverse instruction process. While maintaining comprehensive directional flow, slight variations in left/right turns can add complexity, but confidence is maintained due to simple directional logic and explicit path instructions.
