Explanation: This route seems to be in the Old Mill/Kingsway area of Etobicoke, based on the coordinates and the mention of Riverside Drive, Old Mill Drive, and Halford Avenue.  I'm reasonably familiar with the Old Mill area. The "keep right/left" instructions introduce some ambiguity, but the presence of named streets makes it easier to follow the general path.  Potential POIs include Old Mill subway station, the Humber River and its parks, and the Old Mill Inn.
