Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be in the Yonge and Eglinton (midtown) area, though it's difficult to be more precise without street names.  The long 808.4-meter segment strongly suggests using a major arterial road, perhaps Yonge Street or Mount Pleasant Road, both of which run north-south in this area. The other segments likely involve smaller side streets. I'm fairly confident (90%) in the reversal because the structure of the route suggests a relatively straightforward return journey. However, without access to a map, I can't be certain about potential one-way streets or other minor road features that could require small adjustments. Possible POIs near this route could include businesses and residential buildings along Yonge Street, or perhaps a nearby park or school.
