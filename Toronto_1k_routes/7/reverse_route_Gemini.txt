Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the Bloordale Village/Junction area based on the street names like Lansdowne, Rideau, and St. Clarens.  However, the numerous short segments and turns, including many unnamed ones, make precise reversal challenging. I'm reasonably confident about the named street portions, but the many small adjustments reduce my overall confidence to 70%. Potential POIs in this area include Bloor GO Station and the shops and restaurants along Bloor Street West.
