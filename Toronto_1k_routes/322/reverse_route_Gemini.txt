Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the Leslieville/Greektown area. Pape Avenue and Badgerow Avenue are good reference points, and Brighton Avenue is also in this area.  The numerous turns and shorter segments likely navigate the residential streets east of Pape.  However, the "sharp right/left" and "slight left" instructions introduce some uncertainty, as does the lack of a continuous major road for most of the route. Potential POIs might include Pape subway station, Withrow Park, and the shops and restaurants along Pape and Danforth Avenues.
