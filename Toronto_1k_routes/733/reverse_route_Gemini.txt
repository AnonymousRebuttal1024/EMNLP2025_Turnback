Reasoning: This route seems to primarily follow Lawrence Avenue West, a major east-west artery in Toronto.  I'm very familiar with Lawrence Ave W, and the long straight segment makes the reversal easy.  The short initial and final segments introduce slight uncertainty. Potential landmarks or POIs could include Yorkdale Shopping Centre (if the location is closer to the 401/Allen Road) or the Lawrence West subway station.
