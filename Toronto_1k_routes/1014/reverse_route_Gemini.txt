Confidence: 80%

Reasoning:  This route seems to be in the downtown core, possibly near the Entertainment District or the Fashion District, given its proximity to the coordinates for previous examples. The relatively short segments and numerous slight turns suggest navigating denser city blocks. The "keep right" instructions might indicate slight curves in the road or maneuvering around small obstacles. The lack of street names makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact route with high confidence, but the general pattern of movement suggests a plausible path through the downtown grid. I'm reasonably confident in the reversal of the turns, but the precise distances and angles could be slightly off due to the lack of specific landmarks. Potential POIs could include theaters, restaurants, or shops, depending on the exact location within this downtown area. I cannot pinpoint specific POIs without further information.
