Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route appears to start somewhere slightly northeast of the intersection of Dundas West and Dufferin and heads generally southwest. The long 545.1m stretch makes me suspect it's along Dundas Street West, but without any street names confirmed, it's difficult to be certain.  The numerous "keep right/left" instructions and shorter segments suggest navigating curves and smaller streets, possibly related to the railway lines or the underpass in that area. My confidence is moderate due to the lack of named streets and the multiple slight turns, making it difficult to reconstruct a precise mental map. Possible POIs could include businesses along Dundas Street West, or residential buildings, as the destination seems to be further southwest in a likely residential zone.
