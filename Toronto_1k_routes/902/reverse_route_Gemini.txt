Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the west end, possibly near or within the Christie Pits Park area, based on the coordinates.  Northumberland Street helps anchor the location. The large number of short segments, turns, and "keep right" instructions make it challenging to precisely reconstruct mentally, which reduces my confidence.  POIs might include Christie Pits Park itself, residential buildings, and possibly businesses along Bloor Street West or Ossington Avenue.
