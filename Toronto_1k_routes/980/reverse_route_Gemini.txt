Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the York area, northwest of downtown, near Downsview. Trethewey Drive and Greenbrook Drive are key streets in that area, and Keele Street is a major north-south artery. The long segment on Greenbrook Drive reinforces this location.  The shorter segments suggest turns onto smaller residential streets or potentially pedestrian pathways.  My confidence is reasonably high because of the named streets and the clear structure of the route.
