Confidence: 80%

This route is complex and located in the Beaches neighborhood, likely east of Woodbine Avenue and north of Queen Street East. The inclusion of Juniper Avenue, Glen Ames, Southwood Drive, Glen Manor Drive East, Pine Glen Road, Pine Crescent and Sycamore Place gives me a good sense of place, and confirms it's a primarily residential area. The many short segments, "keep left/right" instructions, "slight" and "sharp" turns signify navigating a residential grid with curves and some less straightforward intersections. This makes precise reversal without a map a bit tricky.  While the street names are helpful, the sheer number of turns and nuances increases the potential for minor errors in the reverse directions.  I'm reasonably confident due to the street names, but some on-the-ground verification might be necessary. There are no immediately obvious landmarks besides the residential character of the area.
