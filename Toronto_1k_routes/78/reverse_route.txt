**Confidence: 85%**

**Reason:** The route involves multiple turns both at the ground level and through the pedestrian PATH network, requiring detailed attention for precise navigation. It includes specific streets like Grange Avenue and Renfrew Place, providing clarity for key segments. The path complexity is higher than typical due to PATH usage and frequent transitions, which are diligently reversed. Inherent complexity from urban paths leads to a medium-high confidence level, acknowledging potential urban variability or nuance in seamless execution across mixed public-access spaces.
