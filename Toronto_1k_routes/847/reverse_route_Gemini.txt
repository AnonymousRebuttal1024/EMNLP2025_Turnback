Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: The route seems to loop around, given the two "sharp" turns and the several other turns. The "keep left" instructions suggest following a main road.  Lack of street names makes pinpointing POIs or the exact location challenging. I am reasonably confident given the limited number of overall instructions, but the turns lower my certainty slightly.  The starting coordinates suggest an area possibly near the Don Valley or East York based on previous queries, but it's hard to be more precise. Potential POIs could include residential buildings, possibly a park, or some commercial establishments, depending on the actual streets involved.
