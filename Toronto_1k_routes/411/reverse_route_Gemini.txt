Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is relatively straightforward, with a manageable number of turns and reasonably long stretches.  The starting point being on Charlotte Street provides a good anchor. The route appears to be in the Annex neighborhood, possibly near the University of Toronto. The 584.9m segment likely represents a major road like Spadina or Bathurst.  The relative simplicity of the route increases confidence in the reversal.  Potential POIs could include the University of Toronto campus buildings, or shops and restaurants along Spadina or Bloor St.
