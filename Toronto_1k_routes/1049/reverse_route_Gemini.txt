Confidence: 80%

Reasoning:  This route seems to be in the west end, possibly near Dundas West and Runnymede, based on the coordinates.  The mix of shorter and longer segments, combined with the "keep left" and "slight" turn instructions, suggests navigating residential streets with some curves. The lack of street names makes it challenging to be precise, but the general pattern of movement provides a reasonable framework for reversing the directions. Potential POIs could include the shops along Dundas Street West or the residential areas surrounding this location.  I'm reasonably confident about the reversal, but the "slight" turns introduce a bit of uncertainty regarding the exact angles.
