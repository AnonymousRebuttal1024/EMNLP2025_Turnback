Confidence: 90%

The presence of street names (Kimberley Avenue, Lyall Avenue, Main Street, Kenilworth Avenue) gives me strong confidence. The route likely passes through a mix of residential and potentially commercial areas, given the presence of Main Street.  The series of turns suggests a moderately complex route, but the street names help anchor the directions.  This route is in the East End Danforth area.
