**Confidence: 85%**

**Reason:** The routes and changes in direction have been carefully considered to maintain a logical flow, with particular attention to the sequence of lefts and rights reversing correctly. The confidence level slightly drops below maximal due to the potential complexity and variability of navigating through specific paths like St. Patrickâ€™s Market and other distinct local paths. In urban settings like near Renfrew Place, various pedestrian or minor paths may introduce slight contextual navigation variables which aren't detailed in this route.
