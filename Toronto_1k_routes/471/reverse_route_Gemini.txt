Confidence: 90%

"Gunns Road" is a clear indicator, placing the route in the Islington-City Centre West neighbourhood, specifically near the intersection of Bloor Street West and Islington Avenue. The many short turns and distances suggest navigating residential streets or potentially within a parking lot or commercial complex.  The “slight left” and “slight right” introduce minor uncertainty, but the named street and the generally simple progression give me high confidence.  There are no immediately obvious landmarks nearby.  Islington subway station could be within a reasonable distance based on the coordinates.
