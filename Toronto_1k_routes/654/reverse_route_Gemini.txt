Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the Junction Triangle area, west of downtown. Pelham Avenue is a good landmark.  The 324.1-meter segment likely corresponds to a moderately long street, possibly Dupont Street or Dundas Street West.  The shorter segments suggest navigating smaller residential streets.  The “sharp right” turn might be onto a street like Sterling Road. The lack of additional named streets and the relatively short overall route slightly reduce my confidence, but the presence of Pelham Ave is a useful anchor.  Potential POIs could include the railway lines and industrial areas near the south, or residential buildings and smaller parks as you move north.
