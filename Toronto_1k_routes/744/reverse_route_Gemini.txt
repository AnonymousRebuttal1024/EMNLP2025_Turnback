Confidence: 65%

Reasoning: This route, likely in the Beaches neighborhood based on the presence of Kenilworth and Norway Avenues near Queen Street East, has a high number of turns, many of them on unnamed streets. This makes it hard to be very precise in the reversal, as I'm relying on a general sense of the area's street grid.  I'm less certain about the exact configuration of the smaller residential streets. Potential landmarks might include the Beaches boardwalk along Lake Ontario or Kew Gardens park.
