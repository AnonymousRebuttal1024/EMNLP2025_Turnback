This route appears to be in the Victoria Park and O'Connor area, possibly near the East Don Parklands, based on the coordinates and the mention of Dohme Avenue and Old Eglinton Avenue. These streets act as landmarks, and the relatively few turns make the route reasonably easy to reverse. The "slight right" and "sharp left" instructions introduce some ambiguity as to the precise angles, but the overall pattern suggests a fairly high degree of accuracy.  Potential POIs near this route might include the East Don Parklands trail system or the Taylor Creek Park.
