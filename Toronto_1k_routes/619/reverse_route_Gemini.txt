Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route seems to be in a residential area, possibly near Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue, given the names like "Manor Road East" and "Hillsdale Avenue East" which sound like that area. The many turns suggest a winding path, perhaps with some smaller residential streets. I'm somewhat confident, but the numerous turns make it harder to maintain a precise mental map without a visual aid. The frequent turns decrease my confidence as itâ€™s more difficult to visualize in reverse without being on the ground. Possible POIs might include schools or local parks, which are common in those residential neighborhoods. I'd need a map to boost my confidence significantly.
