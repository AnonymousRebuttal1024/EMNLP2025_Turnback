Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route is relatively straightforward with several named streets (Gould Street, Victoria Street), providing a reasonable geographical context, likely in a more central or slightly less residential part of Toronto. Reversing the directions is fairly easy. The slight turns and some short segments introduce a small degree of uncertainty, which is why I don't give a 100% confidence. The mention of Gould Street and Victoria Street suggests a slightly more central or mixed-use area in Toronto.
