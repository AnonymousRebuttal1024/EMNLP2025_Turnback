Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: The inclusion of Joe Bertucci Lane and Hepbourne Street provides good location information. This area is in the Liberty Village neighborhood, just west of downtown. Knowing these streets helps considerably in reconstructing the route, particularly since Hepbourne St is a relatively long, straight road. The shorter turns and distances in the beginning, particularly around Joe Bertucci Lane, add a slight degree of uncertainty, but the overall reversal is likely quite accurate. Potential POIs nearby include the various restaurants and shops in Liberty Village, as well as Exhibition Place a bit further south.
