Explanation: This route navigates through what is possibly a blend of residential and community spaces in midtown Toronto, possibly stretching close to Yonge Street or nearby corridors. The organized phasing combines local roadway strides with balanced turning operations conducive to dynamic urban grids reflected in Toronto’s city maps.
