Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the Swansea neighborhood, likely close to High Park and the Humber River. The presence of Windermere Avenue, Windermere Place, and Coe Hill Drive strongly anchors the route, giving me high confidence in the reversed directions.  The "sharp left" is interpreted as "slight right" in reverse, assuming a gentler turn.  High Park itself, Grenadier Pond, and the surrounding residential area would be prominent landmarks.
