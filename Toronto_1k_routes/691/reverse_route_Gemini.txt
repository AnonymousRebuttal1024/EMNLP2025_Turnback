Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Corso Italia neighbourhood, based on the presence of Rosemary Lane.  The turns suggest navigation through residential streets. I'm fairly confident in the reversal, particularly with Rosemary Lane providing a strong anchor.  The remaining segments are a bit less certain without additional street names for cross-referencing. St. Clair Avenue West might be a nearby landmark.
