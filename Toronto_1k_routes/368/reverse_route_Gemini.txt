Confidence: 65%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the downtown core, likely near the Entertainment District or the Fashion District, starting south of Queen Street West. Cameron Street and Sullivan Street are helpful markers.  However, the high number of short segments and turns indicates a complex path, possibly involving alleys, pedestrian walkways, or even interior passages within larger building complexes, which are very difficult to pinpoint without a map. Potential POIs could include theaters, restaurants, bars, and retail stores in the Entertainment District, or showrooms and design studios in the Fashion District.  The route's complexity lowers my confidence in the precise accuracy of the reversed directions.
