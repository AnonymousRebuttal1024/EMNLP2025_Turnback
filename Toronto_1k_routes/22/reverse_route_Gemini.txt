Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: My confidence is 75% because the route involves a number of smaller streets and turns, making precise reversal without a map somewhat challenging.  The inclusion of street names like Dunkirk Road, Queensdale Avenue, Monarch Park Avenue, and Milverton Boulevard helps in the reversal process, boosting confidence. However, the numerous short segments and less precise directional cues (slight right, slight left) introduce some uncertainty in the exact distances and positions of turns in the reversed route.  The general area is familiar to me, but without precise mapping data, some small deviations are possible.
