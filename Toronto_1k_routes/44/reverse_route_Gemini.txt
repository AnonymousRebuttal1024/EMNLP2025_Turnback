Confidence: 97%

Reasoning: The reversal is largely confident due to the relatively clear sequence of turns and street names. The slight reduction in confidence (to 97%) comes from the presence of several short segments and "slight" turns.  These smaller adjustments might vary slightly depending on the precise mapping data and GPS point used.  The area is likely residential, and I don't have enough information to identify specific landmarks along the route.
