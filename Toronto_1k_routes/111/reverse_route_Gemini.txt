Confidence: 98%

Reason: The route is a very simple linear progression along a single road, with only a couple of very short turns.  The reversal is trivial, and the distances are quite plausible for a Toronto street. The high confidence stems from the simplicity and straightforward nature of the route. I don't know the exact location of Atlas Avenue, but the route is simple enough that I am very confident in the reversal. There is not enough information to identify specific POIs.
