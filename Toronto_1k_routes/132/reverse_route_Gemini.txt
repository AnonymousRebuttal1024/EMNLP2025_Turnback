Confidence: 95%

Reason:  The route description involves fairly straightforward turns and street names.  My confidence is high because the instructions provided are specific enough that reversing them produces a clear and logical path. The street names (Glen Manor Drive West, Hammersmith Avenue, etc.) are reasonably well-known within that part of Toronto, and I can visualize the route, placing it near the High Park area.  The minor variations in precise distances would be typical of the real-world variations youâ€™d find in navigating.  The only potential area for slight error is in interpreting "slight left/right" turns, but in the context of the entire route, these are minor and unlikely to cause significant misdirection.
