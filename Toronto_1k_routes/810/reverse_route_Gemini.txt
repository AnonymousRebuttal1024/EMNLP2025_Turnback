This route appears to be in the Islington-City Centre West neighbourhood, close to the Humber River and south of Eglinton Avenue West, based on the coordinates. Irving Road helps to give me a general idea of the area.  The frequent turns, short segments, and "keep left/right" instructions suggest a winding path through possibly residential streets. It is challenging to recreate the exact route without being there physically. Humber Marshes Conservation Area would be a possible nearby POI.
