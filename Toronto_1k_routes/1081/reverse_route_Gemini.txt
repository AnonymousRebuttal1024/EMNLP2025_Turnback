Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: The mention of the West Toronto Railpath significantly increases confidence, as it's a distinct landmark. This path follows a former railway line, making it relatively straight. The route starts near Dundas Street West, slightly west of Keele Street, and heads generally south. The turns after the railpath likely involve residential streets in the Junction Triangle. While I'm less certain about the precise nature of those turns, the railpath itself and the overall distances make the reversal fairly reliable. POIs near the route might include the shops and restaurants along Dundas St W and the green spaces around the railpath.
