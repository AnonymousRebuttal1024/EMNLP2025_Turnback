Confidence: 75%

This route seems to be in the East York neighborhood, east of the Don Valley Parkway.  The lack of street names makes pinpointing the exact location challenging. The mixture of shorter and longer segments suggests a combination of smaller residential streets and potentially a main road. I'm reasonably confident in the general sequence of the reverse directions, but the absence of street names and the "slight left" interpretation (translated as "slight right") introduce some uncertainty. Potential landmarks might include residential buildings, local businesses, and possibly parks in the vicinity.
