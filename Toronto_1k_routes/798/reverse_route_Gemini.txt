This route appears to be in the Riverdale area east of the Don Valley Parkway, based on street names like Minto, Sears, Knox, Memory Lane, Laing, Coady, and Mallon, and the coordinates. These street names help significantly. The numerous short segments and several "keep left/right" instructions introduce some uncertainty, as they may represent minor adjustments, alleys, or driveways, which can be hard to pinpoint in reverse. Riverdale Park East would be a potential nearby POI.
