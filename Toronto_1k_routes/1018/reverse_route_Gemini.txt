Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to be just east of the Don Valley Parkway, north of Riverdale, potentially near the intersection of Broadview Avenue and Danforth Avenue, based on the coordinates and the presence of Baltic Avenue. The initial short segments and turns suggest navigating residential streets, followed by a longer stretch that might be along a main road like Broadview. The mention of Baltic Avenue provides a key landmark, significantly boosting my confidence in the accuracy of the reversal. I am reasonably confident in the general southward direction to return to the start and most of the turn sequence.  Potential POIs near this route could include the shops and restaurants along Danforth Avenue, Riverdale Park, or the Don Valley trails.
