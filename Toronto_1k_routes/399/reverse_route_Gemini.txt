Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Upper Beaches near Woodbine and Gerrard/Danforth. The presence of Brookside Drive helps to anchor the route. The several turns suggest navigation through residential streets.  The 406.6m segment might indicate a main road. I am moderately confident in the reversal, but the multiple turns without specific street names make complete certainty difficult. Potential POIs might include shops along Queen Street East, or a local park nearby.
