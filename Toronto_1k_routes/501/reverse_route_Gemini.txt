Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to be dominated by a long stretch, likely along a major road, given the 967.2-meter segment. Lansdowne Avenue serves as a key landmark, and places the route in the west end, possibly near the Junction area. The initial and final legs are generally north-south, matching the coordinate changes.  The "keep left/right" instructions introduce some uncertainty, as they could represent slight curves or more defined turns. I'm fairly confident in the main sections, but the shorter segments and curves could be slightly off without a map.
