Explanation: The route orders itself through determined paths and urban lanes native to Toronto's inner city, including Baldwin Street. These paths have a distinguishable nature and consistent grid, allowing relatively intuitive backtracking. Despite an involved collection of turns among alleyway-like lanes such as Alley Cat Lane, accurately recognized thoroughfares underline the configuration, helping maintain spatial correlations vital for sound reversals in Toronto's defined neighborhood spaces.
