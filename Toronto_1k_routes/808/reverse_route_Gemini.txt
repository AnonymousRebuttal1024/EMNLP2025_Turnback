This route appears to be in the Yonge and Eglinton/Mount Pleasant area, based on the coordinates and the mention of Edith Drive, Colin Avenue and Hillsdale Ave West.  These street names help to anchor the route. The presence of several "slight," "sharp," and "keep right" instructions suggest curves and smaller turns, making the precise reversal a bit more challenging.  Likely POIs would include the parks and greenspaces that are common in this region, or businesses along Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue West.
