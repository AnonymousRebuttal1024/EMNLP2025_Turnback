Confidence: 85%

Explanation: The journey runs along West Toronto streets and involves typical city navigation, which requires caution when backtracking intricate turns and slight directional adjustments commonly found in this area, likely near York or Junction neighborhoods. Despite this, the sequence of primary navigation points and left-right turn dynamics maintains a clear map in retrieval, aided by directional consistency of major roads and less variability along range extents. This balance contributes to a cautiously optimistic confidence level in accurately reversing the path, accounting for possible urban subtleties.
