Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route seems to follow the Martin Goodman Trail, a prominent waterfront path in Toronto.  The numerous turns and relatively short distances suggest a winding path, likely along the shoreline of Lake Ontario. I am quite confident about the initial and final north/south orientation given the starting and ending coordinates change primarily in latitude. The mention of Martin Goodman Trail greatly increases confidence, as I know its general layout. There's a slight possibility of small deviations or spurs along the trail that I might not have captured, hence the slight reduction from 90%.  This area is likely near Humber Bay Shores Park, given the coordinates and the trail's location.
