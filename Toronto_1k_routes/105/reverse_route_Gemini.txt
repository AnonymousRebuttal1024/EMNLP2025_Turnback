Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route primarily follows Massey Square, a recognizable landmark in Toronto, making the reversal relatively straightforward.  The distances and turns seem plausible for the area. However, the lack of other named streets in the instructions introduces some uncertainty.  The confidence would be higher if additional street names were provided, allowing for more precise verification.  The area around Massey Square is a mix of residential and commercial buildings.
