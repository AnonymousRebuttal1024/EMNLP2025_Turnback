Confidence: 98%

Reasoning: The reversal is highly confident because the route is relatively straightforward with clear turns and street names. The only potential for minor error comes from the precise measurements of shorter segments, and the slight left turn, but the overall route integrity remains strong.  The area is residential, and while there aren't major landmarks directly on the route, it's close to the Cabbagetown neighbourhood.
