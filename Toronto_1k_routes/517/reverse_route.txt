Confidence: 85%

Explanation: The route involves straightforward streets with familiar residential turns, such as Hemlock Avenue and Battenberg Avenue, primarily in a neighborhood setting composed of short blocks. While street names and residential layout improve the confidence in the reversal process, close-proximity turns introduce a slight uncertainty factor. Likely located in a neighborhood like East Toronto, the configuration of roads offers simple, yet effective spatial cueing, maintaining accuracy in reversing directions through these suburban streets.
