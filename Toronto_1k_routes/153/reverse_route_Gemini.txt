Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route is relatively long and straight with few turns, making the reversal straightforward. However, the lack of street names and the presence of several "Keep right/left" and "slight left" instructions introduce some ambiguity. While the overall direction is clear, the precise path might vary slightly in the reversed version.  The long distance suggests a route that might be along a major road or a less densely developed part of Toronto.  There's no obvious landmark I can identify based on the information provided.
