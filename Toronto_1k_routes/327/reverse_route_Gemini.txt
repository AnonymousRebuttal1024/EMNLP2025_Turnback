Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route appears to start near the intersection of Dundas Street West and Dufferin Street, then heads generally north. The long stretch on an unnamed road likely corresponds to a major street like Dufferin Street or Ossington Avenue.  The presence of several "keep left" instructions suggests navigating a larger intersection or possibly a road with multiple lanes. Without specific street names, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact path and confidently reverse the more minor turns. Potential POIs near this route could include Dufferin Mall and the shops and restaurants along Dundas West.
