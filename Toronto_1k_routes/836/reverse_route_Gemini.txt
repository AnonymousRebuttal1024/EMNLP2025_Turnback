Reasoning: Dickens Street provides a good anchor, and the route is fairly simple with only a few turns. "Keep left" likely signifies staying on a main road. "Sharp right" indicates a more defined turn, possibly onto a smaller street.  POIs are hard to specify without cross-street information, but the area appears residential, suggesting homes or small apartment buildings. The relatively straightforward nature of the route makes me confident in the reversal. Dickens Street is likely in the east end near the Leslieville or Riverdale neighborhoods of Toronto, according to my knowledge of the city's layout, as these neighborhoods have streets named after famous authors.
