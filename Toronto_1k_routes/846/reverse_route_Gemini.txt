Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: Robinson Street and Humbert Street provide solid landmarks, increasing confidence. However, the multiple "slight" turns, "keep right/left" instructions introduce ambiguities, as these are hard to reverse precisely without visual aid. The area seems residential based on street names. Potential POIs: Residential buildings along these streets, perhaps small businesses depending on the specific location near Parkdale or Roncesvalles, given the coordinates and my knowledge of Toronto's west end.
