Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the York University Heights/Jane and Finch area. Northgate Drive is a residential street near York University. The long 810.3-meter segment very likely follows Finch Avenue West.  This makes the reversal quite simple.  My confidence is high due to the named street and the presumed presence of Finch Avenue.
