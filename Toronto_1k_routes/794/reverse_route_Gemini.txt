Confidence: 80%

This route is near the Wychwood Park area, likely near Davenport Road and Christie Street, given the coordinates and the unique name "Art Lives Here Lane". This lane helps anchor the route.  However, the large number of turns and several short unnamed segments make it harder to be fully confident in the reversal.  The "slight right" instruction introduces ambiguity, as it is hard to know the precise angle of the turn. I'm reasonably confident in the major portions of the reversed route, particularly around the named streets, but there's potential for small errors with some of the minor turns.  Nearby POIs would likely include residential buildings and possibly small local businesses.
