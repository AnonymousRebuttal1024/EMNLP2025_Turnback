Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route appears to start in the Rosedale neighbourhood and head generally west, likely toward Yonge Street.  Chestnut Park and Rowanwood Avenue help locate the starting area, which is quite residential.  The 561.2 meter segment suggests a major road like Mount Pleasant Road or possibly Yonge Street itself. However, the many short turns and "keep left/right" instructions make it difficult to maintain a precise mental image without a visual aid.  POIs near the start could include Rosedale Park or the Rosedale subway station if the route gets close. I'm moderately confident, but the lack of more easily recognizable major streets and the numerous turns lower my certainty.
