Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: I'm reasonably confident about the initial and final segments of this route as they involve major streets like Gledhill, Holborne, and Cedarvale, which I'm familiar with their general layout in relation to each other.  The mid-section through the Taylor Creek Hydro Corridor and trails is less certain. While I know these green spaces exist in the general area, the specific paths and turns within them are less clear from my general knowledge. Therefore, there might be slight inaccuracies in the turns and distances within the park sections, particularly regarding "keep right/left" instructions, which are harder to precisely reverse without a visual map. I have added likely street names and points of interest based on my knowledge of the area, boosting my confidence.  The starting point appears to be near the residential area west of Pape Ave, and the destination is close to the Taylor Creek Park trail system.
