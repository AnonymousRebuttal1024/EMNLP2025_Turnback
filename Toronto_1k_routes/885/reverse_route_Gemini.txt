Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route is near the waterfront in the Port Lands, south of the Distillery District, based on the coordinates and the mention of Cherry Street and the Martin Goodman Trail.  I'm quite familiar with this area.  The route is relatively straightforward, increasing my confidence in the reversal.  POIs would include the Martin Goodman Trail itself, potentially some industrial buildings, and views of Lake Ontario.  The proximity to the water and the presence of the trail and Cherry Street makes this area relatively easy to visualize.
