Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the Yorkdale-Glen Park neighbourhood, near the Downsview Airport. Flemington Road, New Heights Court, and Varna Drive provide solid location information. The longer segments and relatively few turns suggest it uses larger residential streets or collector roads. I'm quite confident in the reversal due to the inclusion of these street names.  Downsview Park might be a visible landmark.
