Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the O'Connor-Parkview neighborhood, likely involving a stretch along Eglinton Avenue East.  The longer segment suggests following a major road, and the shorter turns indicate navigating smaller side streets. The lack of street names makes it difficult to be absolutely certain of the location. I'm fairly confident in the sequence of reversed turns but less so about the precise positions without street names.  Potential landmarks might include residential buildings, small businesses along Eglinton Avenue East, and perhaps parkland if the route is closer to the Don River valley.
