Confidence: 80%

Explanation:  This route seems to be in the Distillery District. Strange Street, Woodgreen Place, Jack Layton Way, and Blue Rodeo Drive are all located within or very close to this area. The many turns reflect the pedestrian-oriented layout of the district, with its cobblestone streets and former industrial buildings. I'm fairly confident in the main portions of the route, especially those along the named streets. However, some of the short segments could represent alleys, courtyards, or passages within the Distillery District, which are harder to identify without a site map. Potential POIs are numerous here, including restaurants, shops, art galleries, and the Young Centre for the Performing Arts.
