Confidence: 60%

Explanation: This route is very complex with many turns, making it difficult to reconstruct mentally. The route seems to go through a residential area east of downtown, potentially near Pape and Danforth, judging by the mention of Pape Avenue and the lengths of the segments.  "Busy Street" is likely a main road like Danforth or Gerrard. The start seems to be close to Withrow Park, and the destination somewhere northeast of that.  The sheer number of instructions greatly reduces my confidence in accurately reversing the route without visual aids. Potential POIs could be shops and restaurants along Danforth Avenue, or residential buildings.
