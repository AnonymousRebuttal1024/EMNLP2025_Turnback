Reasoning: The specific street names Boulton Avenue and Greig Avenue pinpoint the location to Cabbagetown, east of the downtown core. This makes reversing the route fairly straightforward.  The initial long eastward stretch likely follows Gerrard Street East or a parallel street, and the shorter segments after the turn onto Greig are easy to reverse with the street names as reference points. Some potential landmarks near this area are Riverdale Park West and the shops and restaurants along Parliament Street.
