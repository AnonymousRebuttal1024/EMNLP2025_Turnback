Explanation: This route appears to be in the Trinity-Bellwoods area, based on the street names (Shaw, Crawford, Montrose, Grace, Bellwoods) and coordinates.  I am somewhat familiar with this area, known for its residential streets and proximity to Trinity Bellwoods Park. The high number of turns, along with some "slight" turns, makes precise mental reconstruction and reversal difficult. POIs might include Trinity Bellwoods Park, the Queen West shops and restaurants, and residential buildings.
