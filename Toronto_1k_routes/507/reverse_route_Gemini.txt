Confidence: 65%

Reasoning: This route is quite long and complex, suggesting a path through a densely built-up area, probably close to downtown. Centre Avenue and Chestnut Street, along with Temperance Street near the end, are helpful landmarks. I believe this area is close to the Entertainment District, based on those street names and the general pattern of the route.  However, the numerous unnamed turns and short distances make it tricky to reverse with high accuracy. The "keep right/left" and "slight right" instructions introduce ambiguity, as their exact meaning depends on the street layout.  I'm reasonably confident in the main segments along the named streets, but less so about the shorter, unnamed sections.
