This route appears to be in the Liberty Village/Exhibition Place area given the coordinates, with Newfoundland Road as the only named street, which isn't a very major road.  The abundance of turns, especially four right turns in a sequence, suggest a rather winding path, possibly navigating around the Exhibition grounds or through the residential streets to the north. The numerous "keep left/right" and "slight turn" instructions further increase the ambiguity. Due to the complexity and lack of distinct landmarks, I'm relatively less certain about the precise reversal of every turn. Exhibition Place would be the major POI near this route.
