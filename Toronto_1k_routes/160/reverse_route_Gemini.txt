Confidence: 92%

Reason: The route includes several street names (Garden Avenue, Fern Avenue, MacDonell Avenue, Rideau Avenue, Whytock Avenue), giving a good geographical context, likely in a residential area of Toronto.  Reversing is fairly straightforward. The slight reduction in confidence is due to the several turns and the presence of “slight left” turns which can be subject to slightly different interpretations in the real world compared to the given instructions.  There might be minor variations between the original and reversed route, but the street names provide a good framework for accurate reversal.
