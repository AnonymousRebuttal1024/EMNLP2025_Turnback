Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the northwest part of Toronto, near York University, based on the coordinates and the mention of streets like Tavistock and Sir William Hearst Avenue. I'm reasonably familiar with the general layout of major streets around York University, and the inclusion of these street names increases my confidence. However, the route includes a few unspecified turns, and the "keep left" instruction adds some ambiguity, making the precise reversal a bit less certain.  Potential POIs might include York University buildings, residential areas, and potentially Black Creek Pioneer Village if the route is further west.
