Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the west end, possibly near Dufferin Grove Park given the street name "Dufferin Park Avenue".  Gladstone Avenue is also a familiar west-end street. I'm reasonably confident (80%) about the reversal because the instructions suggest a fairly regular street grid.  However, without a map, I can't be 100% sure about the one-way streets or smaller roads that might require slight adjustments.  The park itself and some residential areas would be likely POIs near this route.
