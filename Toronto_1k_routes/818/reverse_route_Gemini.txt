Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This is a relatively straightforward route involving only a few turns. Wenderly Drive provides a clear landmark.  The "keep right" instruction is likely a minor adjustment to stay on Wenderly, and the final short segment suggests the destination is just off the main road. I have high confidence due to the simplicity of the route. There may not be many significant POIs besides residential homes along Wenderly Drive, but depending on the exact location, there might be a park or a small commercial area nearby.  It seems like this could be in the Etobicoke or York areas of Toronto based on my vague recall of street names.
