Confidence: 75%

Explanation:  This route appears to start near the intersection of University Avenue and Dundas Street West.  The initial eastward direction and then the various turns suggest a path towards Yonge Street and then possibly northward. Without any street names, it's challenging to be entirely precise, but I'm assuming a generally grid-like pattern typical of the downtown core.  The longer straight segments give some confidence in the general direction. Potential POIs could include businesses along Dundas Street West, the Toronto Metropolitan University campus, and various shops and restaurants as it heads east.
