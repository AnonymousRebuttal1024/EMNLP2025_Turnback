Confidence: 85%

While this route lacks street names, the consistent turns and varying distances provide a good framework for reversal.  The "slight left" introduces a bit of uncertainty, as does the "keep right/left", meaning the precise angle might be ambiguous. The general trajectory and flow of the route seem logical, giving me decent confidence.  This area is close to the Don River and likely residential, based on the coordinates. Potential landmarks could include local parks or schools, or perhaps businesses along a nearby main street.
