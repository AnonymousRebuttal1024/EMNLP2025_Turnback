Confidence: 90%

The presence of street names "Euclid Avenue" and "Oscar Ryan Lane" significantly increases my confidence. This places the route near Dundas Street West and Ossington Avenue, a primarily residential area with some commercial businesses. The long, 925.2-meter segment suggests a major road like Dundas St W. The shorter segments and turns likely represent navigation on smaller residential streets or laneways. While the "sharp left" introduces minor uncertainty, the named streets provide strong anchors for the reversal. Trinity Bellwoods Park is a significant landmark nearby.
