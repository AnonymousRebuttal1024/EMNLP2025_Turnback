Confidence: 75%

This route is likely just west of Lansdowne subway station, possibly near Dundas West. I'm less familiar with the specific small streets in this area, so the short segments and turns decrease my confidence a bit.  It's plausible this route incorporates walkways or alleyways rather than strictly following the roads.  The area is mixed residential and commercial.
