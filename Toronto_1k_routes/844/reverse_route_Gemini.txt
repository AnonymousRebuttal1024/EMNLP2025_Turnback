Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: This is a very simple route with a few clear turns, making reverse navigation straightforward and highly confident. The "sharp right" and "slight right" offer some distinct directional changes.  Lacking street names makes it hard to pinpoint POIs, but the location appears to be north-south based on the first instruction and the coordinates suggest it's close to Kensington Market or Chinatown, based on prior queries in this area.
