Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Roncesvalles Village/High Park area, judging by the street names (Sunnyside Avenue, Glen Gordon Road, Indian Road Crescent).  The high number of turns, short segments, and changes in direction indicate a complex route likely through a residential neighborhood. This complexity, especially combined with the lack of clear landmark references other than street names, reduces my confidence in the reversal accuracy. Potential POIs could include High Park itself, the shops and restaurants along Roncesvalles Avenue, or Sunnyside beach/pool, depending on the exact location.
