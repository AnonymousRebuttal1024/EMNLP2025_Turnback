Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in a dense, likely residential, area with frequent turns and short segments.  Markham Street and Robinson Street, along with the smaller Robinson Terrace and Euclid Place, provide helpful landmarks.  This likely places it in the Little Italy/Trinity Bellwoods area. I'm reasonably sure of the reversal, but the many short, unnamed segments introduce uncertainty, especially without a visual representation of the turns.
