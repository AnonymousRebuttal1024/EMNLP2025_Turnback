Confidence: 60%

Reasoning: This route, likely in the High Park/Swansea area near Bloor West Village, is quite intricate with numerous turns. The presence of Gore Vale Avenue and Trinity Circle helps provide context, but the many unnamed segments and changing directions make it hard to reverse with high confidence from memory. Potential landmarks include High Park itself and the surrounding residential areas.  The complexity lowers my confidence.
