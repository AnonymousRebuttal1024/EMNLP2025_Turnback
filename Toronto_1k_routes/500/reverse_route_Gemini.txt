Reasoning: This is a relatively simple route, primarily following a single long stretch after a few initial turns. Bartley Drive serves as a clear landmark, placing this likely near the Victoria Park and Eglinton area. The relatively few turns and the clear north/south dominant direction from the coordinates increase my confidence in the reversed directions.
