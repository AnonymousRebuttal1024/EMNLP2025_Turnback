This route is very detailed with lots of small turns and short distances.  The coordinates suggest it's in the Junction Triangle area, just north of Dundas West. Knowing Perth Avenue and Neepawa Avenue helps to anchor the route.  However, the complexity makes the reversal somewhat less certain, particularly the very short segments which are difficult to precisely place without being on the ground. I've made my best guess at reversing each turn, but some minor errors are possible.  POIs might include the small parks in this area like Perth Square Park or businesses along Dundas Street West.
