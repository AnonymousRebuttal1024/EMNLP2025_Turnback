Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the western part of Toronto, near the Junction area, potentially around High Park North. The presence of street names like Dennis Avenue, Lambton Avenue, Greendale Avenue, Rockcliffe Boulevard, and Alliance Avenue greatly increases my confidence as these are all real and correctly sequenced streets in that area. The longer stretch on Greendale Avenue is a key indicator, along with the final turns onto Rockcliffe and Alliance. Potential POIs in this area could include High Park, the shops along Dundas Street West, or the residential areas surrounding the mentioned streets.
