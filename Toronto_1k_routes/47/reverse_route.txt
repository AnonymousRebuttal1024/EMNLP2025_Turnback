**Reason:** The route is predominantly linear, with some clear street names like King Georges Drive helping guide the navigation. By methodically reversing each clearly structured directional change and keeping turns precise, logical retracing is accomplished. The minimal number of minor turns helps facilitate straightforward navigation, although slight variations may arise from urban factors or road adjustments. However, these are accounted for within a solid framework of street and distance accuracy.
