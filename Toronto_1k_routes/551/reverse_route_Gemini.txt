Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be downtown, potentially near the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) and the Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD). Larch Street and Grange Avenue are near those institutions. The long 707.4-meter segment might be along Dundas Street West, a major east-west artery in that area. My confidence is 85% because the street names and the general layout seem to fit this area.  However, without a map, I cannot be completely sure about the precise location of smaller streets and potential one-way restrictions. POIs near this route include the AGO, OCAD, Grange Park, and various restaurants and businesses along Dundas Street West.
