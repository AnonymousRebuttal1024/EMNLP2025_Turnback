Confidence: 75%

This route seems to be in the Leslieville area, starting near Memory Lane.  Coady Avenue, Mallon Avenue, and Bertmount Avenue help with location identification. The many short segments and turns, particularly in the first half of the route, suggest navigation through residential streets. I am moderately confident; the named streets help, but the numerous and complex turns decrease my certainty about the precise path, especially without visual confirmation.  Potential landmarks could include shops and restaurants along Queen Street East or residential buildings in Leslieville.
