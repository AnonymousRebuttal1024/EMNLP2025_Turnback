Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in a residential area in the northwest part of the city, likely near Keele Street and Eglinton Avenue West, based on street names like Clearview Heights, Irving Road, Keele Street, Lonborough Avenue, Richardson Avenue, Yore Road, and Gabian Way. The mix of short and longer segments and the presence of streets like "Way" suggest a residential neighborhood with a somewhat irregular street pattern. My confidence is 85% because the sequence of streets and turns makes sense for a residential area in this part of Toronto. However, I am uncertain about some details without a map, especially regarding potential one-way streets and small lanes. POIs might include residential homes, parks, schools, and perhaps some local businesses along Keele Street.
