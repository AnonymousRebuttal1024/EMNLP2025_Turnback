Confidence: 85%

Explanation: The reverse directions are created based on the typical patterns of navigation, considering the usual way intersections and directional choices are made. Even though Iâ€™m confident in following these logical patterns, variability in road network and specific intersections means there's some room for error, especially considering a city as complex as Toronto. The starting and ending points seem to be within a residential neighborhood, possibly near the Beaches area, known for its attractive residential streets and proximity to the lakefront, offering landmarks like Kew Gardens and vibrant stretches along Queen Street East. This information helped to guide the reverse route logic and maintain neighborhood context.
