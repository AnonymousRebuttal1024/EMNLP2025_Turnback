Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the Weston area near Black Creek Drive and Eglinton Avenue West, judging by the street names (Erie, Falstaff, Sir William Hearst).  Falstaff Avenue appears to curve, which contributes to a bit of uncertainty. Also, the multiple turns without named streets suggest residential areas where accurate navigation could be tricky.  Potential POIs might include the shops and businesses along Eglinton Avenue West or Weston GO station.
