Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Wilson Heights neighbourhood of North York, near the intersection of Bathurst Street and Wilson Avenue.  The presence of Apex Road and Dufflaw Road significantly increases my confidence, as these are both real streets in that area and their relative positions are consistent. The numerous turns and varied segment lengths suggest navigating local streets in a residential area.  POIs near this route could include Wilson Heights Plaza, the ravine parks in the area, or residential buildings.
