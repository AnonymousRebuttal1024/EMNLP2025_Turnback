Explanation: This route appears to begin near Kensington Market and head northeast towards Chinatown. The mention of Chinatown Mural Lane and Ursula Franklin Street (in the new Regent Park area) are very helpful for orientation. However, the high number of turns and short, unnamed segments makes precise reconstruction difficult.  Kensington Market especially has a very irregular street layout, with many small alleys and pedestrian-only zones.  The later part of the route through Regent Park is also undergoing significant redevelopment, so the street layout is potentially changing. POIs could include the diverse shops and restaurants of Kensington Market, street art, and newer residential and commercial developments in Regent Park.
