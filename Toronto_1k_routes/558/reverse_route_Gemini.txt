Confidence: 70%

This route seems to be in the area just east of downtown, potentially near the waterfront and the Distillery District. The mention of the "Lake Shore Boulevard Recreational Trail" strongly suggests proximity to the waterfront path that runs along Lake Ontario. The many turns and varied distances indicate navigation through a mix of potentially smaller streets and paths. My confidence is around 70% because the waterfront trail provides a good reference point, but the numerous other turns, especially "sharp" and "slight" ones, are difficult to precisely reverse without a map.  I'm also unsure about the accuracy of street configurations so close to the waterfront, as redevelopment in that area has changed the road network over time.  Possible POIs include the Distillery District, Sugar Beach park, and various restaurants and shops along the waterfront.
