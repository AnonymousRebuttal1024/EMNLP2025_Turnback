**Confidence: 85%**

**Reason:** The navigation involves numerous turns and directional changes, with specific streets like Wallace Avenue, Franklin Avenue, and St. Clarens Avenue serving as vital reference points to ensure the route's reversal accurately follows the intended path. Given the high number of turns and keeps, particularly with varied conditions like sharp turns, some uncertainty remains in consistently perfect reversal, especially around potential minor streets or unaccounted turns. However, structured direction and street names mostly confirm the path with a logical flow.
