Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Yonge and Eglinton (midtown) area, based on the presence of Montgomery Avenue and Duplex Avenue. These are relatively well-known streets in that area, giving me some confidence. However, the many unnamed turns and short segments make the precise reversal challenging to reconstruct solely from a mental map. The street grid in that area can be quite complex with smaller residential streets intersecting the larger avenues.  Potential POIs near this route include the Yonge-Eglinton Centre and the surrounding businesses and residential buildings.
