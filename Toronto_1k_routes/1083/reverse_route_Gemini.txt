Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: Highfield Road and Hertle Avenue provide strong anchors, placing this in the Beaches neighborhood east of downtown, near Woodbine Avenue.  While the many turns without named streets introduce some uncertainty, the named streets and the overall pattern of longer and shorter segments allow for reasonably confident reversal.  POIs might include shops and restaurants along Queen Street East or potentially Kew Gardens.
