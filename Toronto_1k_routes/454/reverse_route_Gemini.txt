Confidence: 90%

The specific street names (Renwick Crescent, Pape Avenue, Eastern Avenue) are excellent locators, placing this route just north of Queen Street East in the Leslieville neighbourhood.  The 542.4-meter westward leg likely follows Queen Street itself. Eastern Avenue is a major arterial road, and Pape Avenue is a significant north-south street.  Knowing these streets makes the reversal fairly straightforward.  The very short segments at the end suggest turns off/onto smaller streets or laneways. I am very confident due to the prominent and readily identifiable street names.
