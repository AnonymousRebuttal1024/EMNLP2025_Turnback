Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route includes several street names (Metcalfe Street, Broadcast Lane, Horticultural Avenue, Gerrard Street East, George Street, Mutual Street), which aids in accurate reversal. However, the numerous turns and short distances, along with some "slight left/right" turns, introduce a degree of uncertainty. The longer distances provide some positional information, but the lack of prominent landmarks reduces the confidence slightly.  The area seems to be a mixture of residential and possibly commercial properties in Toronto.
