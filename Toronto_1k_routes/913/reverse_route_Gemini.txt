Confidence: 70%

Reasoning:  The provided coordinates indicate a route near the waterfront in downtown Toronto, likely around Harbourfront Centre and Queens Quay.  I'm reasonably confident in the general direction and street names (Queens Quay is the main road there) based on the area and the turning directions, and this part of Toronto has a relatively regular grid.  However, the very high number of turns suggests the route might be weaving through smaller streets or parking lots, which are harder to predict accurately without a visual map.  I'm also unsure about some of the slight/sharp turn distinctions and whether the final street name should be Queens Quay West or something similar due to forks in the road. Landmarks near this route could include Harbourfront Centre, the Amsterdam Brew Pub, the ferry docks, and possibly the CN Tower in the distance.
