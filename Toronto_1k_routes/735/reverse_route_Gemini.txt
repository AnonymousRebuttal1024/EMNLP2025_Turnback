Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Exhibition Place area, potentially involving some of the internal roads and paths within the grounds. The series of "keep right" instructions suggests curved roads or pathways. While I have a general idea of Exhibition Place's layout, the lack of specific street names makes it hard to be very precise.  Potential landmarks include the Enercare Centre, BMO Field, or the various exhibition halls within Exhibition Place.
