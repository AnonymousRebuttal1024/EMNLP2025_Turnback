Confidence: 97%

Reason: The route is fairly straightforward, with a recognizable street name (Howe Avenue) at the beginning. The reversal is easily done by reversing the direction of the turns and maintaining the distances. The only slight reduction in confidence stems from the less common street names and some of the smaller turns that could have slight variations in their location. The area is likely residential in Scarborough.
