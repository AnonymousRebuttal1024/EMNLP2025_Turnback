Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be near York University, potentially in the neighborhood of York University Heights. Tilbury Drive is located in that area.  The long segments likely follow major roads like Finch Avenue West or Keele Street. The shorter segments are likely connections on smaller residential streets. My confidence is reasonably high because of the named street and the relative simplicity of the route.
