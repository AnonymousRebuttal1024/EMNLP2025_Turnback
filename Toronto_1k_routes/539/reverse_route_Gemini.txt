This route seems to be in a residential area, possibly near the Junction Triangle or just north of it, given the generally west-end coordinates and the combination of short segments and turns. Edwin Avenue is a street I'm somewhat familiar with in that general vicinity. However, without a map, I'm less certain about the exact configuration of the smaller streets and potential one-way restrictions. It's likely some adjustments might be required when navigating on the ground. Potential POIs could include residential homes, possibly some small parks or green spaces, and maybe some light industrial or commercial buildings along the larger streets in the area.
