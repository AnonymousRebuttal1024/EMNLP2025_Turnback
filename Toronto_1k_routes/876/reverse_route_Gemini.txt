Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This is a very long and complex route likely in the Cabbagetown/Leslieville area, based on street names like Jones, Strathcona, and Fenwick, and the coordinates. While I know these streets generally exist, reconstructing this many turns in my mental map is challenging and lowers my confidence. Some instructions like "slight left" and "keep left" introduce further ambiguity. POIs could include Riverdale Park East, which is likely nearby, as well as residential buildings and potentially some small businesses along Gerrard Street East or Queen Street East.
