Confidence: 90%

The inclusion of Silver Birch Avenue, Balmy Avenue, Windsor Avenue, and Blantyre Avenue gives me a high degree of confidence. The "sharp right" and "slight right" add specificity. This area is in the east end, in the Beaches neighbourhood, close to the lake. Potential landmarks include the beach, boardwalk, and the residential streets of the Beaches.
