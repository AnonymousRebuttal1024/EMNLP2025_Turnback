Confidence: 85%

Sunnyside Avenue and Marion Street provide good landmarks, and the detailed turns create a decent structure for reversal, even with a high number of turns.  "Slight left/right" instructions introduce some minor uncertainties, as does "Keep right". This area is in the west end, south of High Park, in the Swansea neighbourhood, close to the lake. Possible landmarks could include the shops and restaurants along Windermere Ave or the residential streets of Swansea, and the waterfront parks.
