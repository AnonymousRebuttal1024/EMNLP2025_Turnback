Confidence: 65%

Reasoning: This route likely starts near the intersection of Bathurst and Bloor and ends closer to Spadina and College. The numerous turns and "keep right/left" instructions make it quite complex, even though the initial southward direction gives some orientation.  The lack of street names adds to the uncertainty.  Potential landmarks might include the University of Toronto campus or the shops and restaurants along Bloor Street, but the lack of specific street names makes it hard to be sure.  The sheer number of steps significantly decreases my confidence in the precise reversal.
