Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the Princess-Rosethorn neighbourhood of Etobicoke, based on the street names.  Cannon Road, Cloverhill, Kinsdale, and Crown Hill Place all exist in this area, and the route likely winds through the residential streets.  While the street names provide good anchors, the lack of visual confirmation makes it slightly less certain, especially the keep right/left instructions, as the exact configuration of these intersections is unknown. POIs are primarily residential in nature in this area.
