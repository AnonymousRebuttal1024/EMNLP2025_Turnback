Confidence: 60%

Reasoning: This is a very complex route with numerous turns in what seems to be a residential area. Based on the street names (Williamson, Lee, Norway, Elmer, Rhyl, Haslett) and the general direction, I would place this in the Upper Beaches, potentially near Woodbine and Gerrard/Danforth. The many short segments and unnamed roads make it challenging to reconstruct the route with high accuracy without a map.  Potential POIs could include shops and restaurants along Gerrard or Danforth, or perhaps a local park. The complexity significantly decreases my confidence in the reversed directions.
