Confidence: 90%

The inclusion of "King Liberty Bridge" and "Crawford Street" provides very strong location information. This area is near King Street West and Dufferin Street. The bridge itself is a significant landmark.  The mix of short segments and turns suggest navigating smaller streets and possibly pedestrian walkways leading up to the bridge.  I have high confidence in the accuracy of the reversal due to the named landmarks and the relatively clear progression of turns. Exhibition Place is a potential nearby landmark, given its proximity to the King Liberty Bridge.
