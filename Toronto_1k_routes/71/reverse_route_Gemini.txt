Confidence: 92%

Reason: The reversal is mostly straightforward, but the numerous short turns and "keep left/right" instructions, especially in the latter half, introduce some uncertainty. The specific street names (Abbott Avenue, Indian Road Crescent, Glenlake Avenue, Pacific Avenue) give a good degree of confidence for the major parts of the route. The area is likely residential, given the street names and the relatively complex, potentially winding nature of the route.  The lack of easily identifiable landmarks beyond street names reduces confidence somewhat.
