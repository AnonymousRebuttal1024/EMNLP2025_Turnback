Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: Palmerston Avenue and Palmerston Square provide good landmarks, and Ossington Avenue is another recognizable street name in the area.  The sheer number of turns, many of which are short distances or "slight" turns, drastically decreases my confidence in a precise reversal.  This route would be very difficult to accurately recreate without a map.  The area is likely west of downtown, near Trinity Bellwoods Park, based on my knowledge of Toronto's street layout. Potential POIs include residential buildings, Trinity Bellwoods Park itself, and possibly some cafes and shops along Ossington Avenue.
