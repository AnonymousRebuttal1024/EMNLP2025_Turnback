Explanation: This route appears to be north of St. Clair Avenue West, near the intersection of St. Clair and Dufferin Street. St. Clair Avenue West, Harvie Avenue, Ascot Avenue, Nairn Avenue, Earlscourt Avenue, and Westmount Avenue provide excellent location information. The route likely navigates through a residential neighbourhood, with some potentially smaller, unnamed streets or laneways. The specific locations of the "Keep Right" instructions are slightly uncertain without a visual map. Potential POIs include residential homes, Earlscourt Park (a bit further west), and businesses along St. Clair Avenue West.
