Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: The very detailed instructions including street names like Dinnick Crescent, St. Edmund's Drive, Glengrove Avenue East, Heather Street, Craighurst Avenue, Rosewell Avenue, Cortleigh Boulevard, and Cortleigh Crescent give me high confidence in the reversal. This route is clearly in the Lytton Park neighborhood, near Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue. The many turns and specific street names make it easy to reconstruct the route in reverse with good accuracy. POIs in this area include Lytton Park itself, the shops and restaurants along Yonge Street, and potentially the North Toronto Memorial Community Centre.
