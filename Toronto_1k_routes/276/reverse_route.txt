Explanation: The route navigates through a part of Toronto east of downtown, potentially through roads and pathways that transverse a mix of residential and urban spaces like those in East York. With distinct long straight paths and a few nuanced maneuvers involving slight turns, reversing the navigational path requires careful tracking of street patterns. The consistency of large spans and known directional guidance around urban planning aids accuracy in backtracking these steps, supported by knowledge of this locale's predictable layout, yields high confidence in reversing the route.
