Confidence: 90%

Evans Avenue is a clear indicator of location in the Mimico neighborhood, specifically south of Lake Shore Blvd W. The short segments and turns suggest a typical residential area. The relatively simple route makes reversal straightforward.  I have high confidence due to the street name and the simple nature of the directions.  There are no immediately obvious landmarks, though Humber College's Lakeshore Campus isn't too far based on the coordinates.
