**Confidence: 90%**

**Reason:** The instructions delineate several tight turns and right/left navigations, with longer distance spans creating a clearer path for structured reversals. The use of distinct road names, such as Carlaw Avenue and Logan Avenue, offers strong reference points for navigation. The sequence supports logical coherence in path structuring, which maintains alignment in urban transit settings. Complexity variables exist, but the directional architecture stands robust to ensure high confidence in step reversals.
