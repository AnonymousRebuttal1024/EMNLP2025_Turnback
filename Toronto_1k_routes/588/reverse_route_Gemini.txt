Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be in the Leaside neighborhood, near the Don Valley Parkway. The presence of Brentcliffe Road, Don Avon Drive, and Fredrick Todd Way provides strong anchoring points.  Fredrick Todd Way is likely a smaller street or pathway related to the Don Valley ravine system. This area offers a mix of residential and parkland.  My confidence is high due to the street names, allowing for accurate reversal. The nearby Don Valley ravine and park system are likely landmarks.
