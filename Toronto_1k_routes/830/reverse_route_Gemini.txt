Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: Broadway Avenue and Hillsdale Avenue East are good anchors.  The many short segments and turns, especially "slight left/right", make precise reversal tricky without a visual map.  "Keep right" is also ambiguous.  Potential POIs could include businesses on Broadway, residential houses on Hillsdale, and perhaps a parkette. The location appears to be north-central Toronto, possibly near Yonge and Eglinton, based on my general knowledge of the street layout and names.
