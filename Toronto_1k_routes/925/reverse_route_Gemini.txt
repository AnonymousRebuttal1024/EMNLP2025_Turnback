Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the Corso Italia neighborhood, west of downtown, possibly near Dufferin Grove Park. The long stretch of 810.5 meters suggests a major road, possibly Dufferin Street or College Street.  I'm confident about the general direction and reversing the turns, but the sharp and slight turn classifications introduce some uncertainty, as do possible smaller streets or lanes along the way. Potential landmarks might include residential homes, Dufferin Grove Park, or shops and restaurants along College Street or Dufferin Street.
