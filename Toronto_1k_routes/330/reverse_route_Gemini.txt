Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Princess-Rosethorn neighbourhood of Etobicoke, close to the Humber River. Cannon Road, Guthrie Avenue, Ringley Avenue, and Aldgate Avenue are all present in this area. The sequence of turns suggests navigating through the residential streets, potentially with some curves and cul-de-sacs. The specific street names add to my confidence, but the lack of a visual map makes it hard to be entirely precise, particularly with "slight right" turns where the angle isn't clearly defined. Potential POIs in this area could include the Humber River recreational trail and residential buildings.
