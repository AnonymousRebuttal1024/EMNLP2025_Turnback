Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to navigate through a residential area, likely with some curving streets, given the "slight right" and "sharp left" instructions.  The inclusion of street names like Glen Park Avenue, Capitol Avenue, Lilywood Road, and Times Road significantly increases my confidence. I'm reasonably certain about the overall east-to-west direction based on the start and end coordinates. I'd place this near the Yorkdale area based on those street names. There might be some minor inaccuracies, especially with the "keep right" instruction, as it could represent a slight curve or a more defined turn. I reduced the confidence slightly because it's difficult to be 100% sure without a visual map.
