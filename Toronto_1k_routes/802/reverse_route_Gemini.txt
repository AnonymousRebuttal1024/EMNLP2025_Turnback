Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in a residential area, possibly in the Victoria Village/Wexford area near O'Connor and St. Clair East based on the coordinates, and the inclusion of Gower Street, Glen Albert Drive, Rexleigh Drive, Glen Gannon Drive, Stag Hill Drive, and Leander Court provides a good structure. I'm reasonably confident in the reversal due to these street names. The presence of "keep left/right" instructions suggest curves, which introduce minor ambiguity, as does the presence of short, unnamed segments, making it harder to be fully certain about every minor turn.  Potential POIs might include the ravine system in the area, or businesses along O'Connor Drive.
