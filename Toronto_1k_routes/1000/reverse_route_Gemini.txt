Confidence: 75%

This route appears to be in the Corso Italia neighborhood, north of St. Clair Avenue West. Indian Road Crescent and Osler Street are located in that area. The many short segments and frequent turns suggest navigating residential streets, which are characteristic of Corso Italia.  The lack of a clearly dominant, long segment makes it harder to pinpoint the exact path and thus reduces my confidence somewhat.
