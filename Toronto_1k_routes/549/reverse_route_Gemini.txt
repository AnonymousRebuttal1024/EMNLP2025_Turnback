Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the  Wexford/Maryvale area of Scarborough, particularly around the intersection of Pharmacy and Lawrence. The street names mentioned (Dohme, Westview, Selwyn, and Merritt) are all found in that area. It seems to be primarily a residential area with some curving streets.  My confidence is relatively high (90%) because of the street names and the relatively straightforward sequence of instructions. However, I am always cautious about minor details without a map, as small lanes and potential one-way streets could always introduce minor variations to the optimal return route.
