Confidence: 85%

Explanation: The route contains several urban maneuvers through the downtown Toronto grid characterized by recognizable street alignments and segment lengths helpful in reverse navigation. Toronto landmarks, like the Eaton Centre or Nathan Phillips Square, often surround streets like Chestnut, enhancing navigational certainty through well-known downtown areas, although some intricate maneuvers and dense complexity slightly moderate confidence in exactitude amidst potentially busy intersections or possible foot traffic-induced detours.
