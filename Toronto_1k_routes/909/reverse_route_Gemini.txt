Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route is likely in the Greektown/Leslieville area, based on the coordinates and the mention of Rhodes Avenue, Craven Road, and Ashdale Avenue. I'm reasonably familiar with this area. Rhodes Avenue is a main north-south street. The route is fairly straightforward, which adds to my confidence. Potential POIs include residential buildings, Pape subway station might be nearby, and businesses along Danforth Avenue, which should be a short walk west of Rhodes.
