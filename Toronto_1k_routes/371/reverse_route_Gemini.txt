Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route is likely in the Yorkdale-Glen Park area, north of Lawrence Avenue West.  Shermount Avenue, Dell Park Avenue, and Dalemount Avenue are very good indicators, and their repeated mention suggests the route winds through a residential neighbourhood. Potential POIs might include residential homes, perhaps a local park or school. The clear street names and relatively straightforward path increase my confidence.
