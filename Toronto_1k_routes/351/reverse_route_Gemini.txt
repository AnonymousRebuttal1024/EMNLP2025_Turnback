Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route is in Riverdale, likely near Withrow Park. Withrow Avenue, Frizzell Avenue, Eastview Path, Strathcona Avenue, and Ben Kerr Lane are all good locators.  The many turns suggest navigating residential streets, likely in a fairly dense area.  I'm reasonably confident about the overall path, especially with the named streets, but the shorter, unnamed segments make it difficult to be perfectly accurate without a map. Potential POIs include Withrow Park, residential homes, and potentially some businesses along Danforth Avenue, which is likely nearby.
