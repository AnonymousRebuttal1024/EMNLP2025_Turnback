Confidence: 95%

This route seems to be in the Beaches, based on the street names Nancy Avenue and Herron Avenue. These are residential streets. The very short route with only one turn makes me highly confident (95%) in the reversed directions.  It's hard to be 100% certain without a map (in case of unexpected road closures, etc.), but the simplicity of this route makes it very likely to be accurate.
