This route is quite intricate, involving numerous turns and a mix of short and long segments. The coordinates and street names (Ryerson, Wolseley, Bathurst) place it in the area west of downtown, likely near Kensington Market or Alexandra Park. These specific streets provide good landmarks.  The several "keep right/left" instructions indicate curves or slight bends in the road, which are harder to precisely reverse.  The many short, unnamed segments add to the complexity, as it's difficult to know the precise nature of these turns without being on the ground.  POIs near this route would include Kensington Market, Alexandra Park, and possibly some businesses along Bathurst Street.
