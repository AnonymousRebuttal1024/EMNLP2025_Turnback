Explanation: This route seems to be south of Bloor Street West, potentially near Dundas West or College Street, based on the coordinates. The lack of street names makes it a bit harder. The longer segments suggest following main roads, but the "slight" turns could be gentle curves or minor adjustments, making it difficult to be precise. Potential POIs might include residential areas, some small parks, and commercial properties along Dundas West or College.
