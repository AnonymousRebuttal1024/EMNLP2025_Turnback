Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This reversal is straightforward given the simple nature of the original route.  The confidence is slightly lower than a perfectly straight, single-road reversal because the turns are precise and there's a possibility the exact turn onto/off Burlington Street and Stanley Ave could vary slightly depending on the mapping data used. The route is near the Humber River and High Park area, but no significant landmarks are directly on it.
