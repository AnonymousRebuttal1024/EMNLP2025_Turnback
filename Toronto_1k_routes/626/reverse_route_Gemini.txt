Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route seems to start near the Entertainment District/Fashion District (south of Dundas on Yonge, perhaps near the Eaton Centre) and goes generally west towards University Avenue/the hospitals area. The mention of Yonge and Simcoe Streets helps anchor this route significantly, and the distances are consistent with that area.  I'm quite confident because of these major streets, although the several other unnamed turns add a little uncertainty. Possible POIs along this route could include the Eaton Centre, Dundas Square, City Hall, or hospitals near University Avenue.
