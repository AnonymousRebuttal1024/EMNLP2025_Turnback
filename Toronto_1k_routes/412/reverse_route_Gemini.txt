Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the Fairbank neighborhood, north of Eglinton Avenue West and east of Dufferin Street.  The street names (Northcliffe, Amherst, Westmount, Martin, Bloem, Sellers) are all located in this residential area. The abundance of turns and short distances, along with several unnamed streets, indicates a fairly complex path through the neighborhood, which makes accurate reversal without a map difficult.  Potential POIs might include Fairbank Memorial Park or the shops along Eglinton West and Dufferin Street.
