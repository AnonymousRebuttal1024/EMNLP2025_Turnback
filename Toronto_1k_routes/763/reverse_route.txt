Confidence: 80%

Explanation: The conversion from directions between points D to S is fairly straightforward. I have utilized street names such as Jameson Avenue and Tyndall Avenue to guide the reversal of each directional instruction. The rerouted path takes into consideration similar transitions and intersections, which lends a substantial degree of confidence to the accuracy. However, without verification against a real-time map, there's a slight margin of error in terms of precise spatial relationships and traffic variations. Note that landmarks like Lamport Stadium Park may be in proximity to some sections of the route.
