Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route is highly complex, starting near Liberty Village and seemingly heading north towards Queen Street West and beyond based on the coordinates and mention of streets like Adelaide St West, Richmond St West, Shank Street, and Jefferson Avenue. I am somewhat familiar with this area, which mixes residential and commercial areas. The many turns, "keep right/left" instructions, and "sharp/slight" turn modifiers make it challenging to mentally track and reverse the directions precisely, reducing my confidence. POIs could include businesses and restaurants along Queen West, Trinity Bellwoods Park if the route continues further north, and residential lofts and buildings in Liberty Village.
