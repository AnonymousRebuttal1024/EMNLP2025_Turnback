Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route likely starts near the University of Toronto and heads generally south towards the area around College Street.  The numerous turns suggest navigating smaller streets, and the 457.5-meter segment is probably a major road like Spadina Avenue or University Avenue. The lack of named streets makes it more difficult to pinpoint the exact route, reducing my confidence.  POIs near the start could include University of Toronto buildings, and closer to the destination, there might be businesses along College Street.
