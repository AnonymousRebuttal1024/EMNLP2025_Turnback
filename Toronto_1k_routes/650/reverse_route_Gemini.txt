Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route appears to start near the Exhibition Place/Liberty Village area, and goes generally northwest. Walnut Avenue and Stanley Terrace provide helpful starting point references.  The 444.2 meter segment likely corresponds to a major road like King Street West or perhaps Strachan Avenue.  The multiple "keep left" instructions and shorter, unnamed segments make it hard to be totally certain without a map.  The numerous turns also decrease my confidence, making precise reversal a bit of a challenge. Potential POIs near the start include Exhibition Place or the Enercare Centre. As the route goes north, it likely enters a more mixed residential/industrial area.
