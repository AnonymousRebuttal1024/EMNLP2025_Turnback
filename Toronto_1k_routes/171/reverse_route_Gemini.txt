Confidence: 80%

Reason: This route lacks street names and relies heavily on a series of turns, making precise reversal without additional information challenging. The numerous turns and short distances make it difficult to be completely certain about the exact route when reversing the directions.  There is a possibility of minor positional errors in the reversed route due to the vagueness of the directions.  I can't infer any landmarks from this route's description.
