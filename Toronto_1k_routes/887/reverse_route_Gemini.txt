Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route is likely in Riverdale, east of Broadview Avenue and possibly near Withrow Park, based on the coordinates and the street names (Montcrest, Broadview, Hogarth).  I'm reasonably familiar with this area, which is mostly residential.  The many short segments and turns, particularly the "sharp" and "slight" turns, make it harder to precisely visualize and reverse, reducing my confidence. POIs could include Withrow Park, residential buildings, and potentially some small businesses along Broadview.
