Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to go through the downtown core, with a mixture of shorter and longer segments suggesting a mix of side streets and main roads. Dalhousie Street and Mutual Street serve as good landmarks. The final northward direction and the relatively large number of turns suggest it might approach the University of Toronto area, given those streets' locations. I'm reasonably confident, but the numerous turns, particularly the shorter ones, make it hard to be absolutely sure without a visual map.
