Reason: The route involves a mix of turns and longer stretches, suggesting a possibly residential area. The street name "Berkeley Street" is recognizable in Toronto, although the exact locations of other smaller roads used are uncertain.  The reversal is logically sound. The high number of turns and the lack of other familiar street names reduce confidence, though the directions are relatively simple to reverse.  There are likely to be residential buildings near this route.
