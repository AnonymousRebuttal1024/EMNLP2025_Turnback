Confidence: 90%

This route is in the Garden District area, close to Allan Gardens. The inclusion of George Street, Gerrard Street East, and Horticultural Avenue allows for a strong reconstruction. Allan Gardens itself is a major landmark along this route, and the area is characterized by a mix of residential buildings, small businesses, and cultural venues. The numerous turns likely reflect the neighborhood's street layout.  I'm quite confident in the accuracy of the reverse due to the specific street names.
