Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the St. Lawrence neighborhood, east of downtown.  It involves a considerable number of turns, suggesting navigation through a fairly dense street grid.  I'm moderately confident about the general reversal of directions, but the specific street names are unknown and the high density of turns increases the chance of small errors.  Potential landmarks in this area might include the St. Lawrence Market, condo buildings, or small parks.
