Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route involves a series of turns through what appears to be a residential area.  The street names (Arundel Avenue, Sparkhall Avenue) sound plausible for Toronto, but I'm not familiar with the precise layout of all the smaller streets involved. The distances are reasonable, and the reversal is straightforward. The slight reduction in confidence is due to the lack of complete familiarity with all the street names and their arrangement relative to one another in that specific area. The area is likely residential, so nearby POIs would be houses.
