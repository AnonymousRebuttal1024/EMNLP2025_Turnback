Confidence: 95%

Reasoning:  This route is likely in the Davisville Village area. Macpherson Avenue, Poplar Plains Road, and Boulton Drive are all located in this neighbourhood, close to Yonge Street. The turns and distances are relatively simple and easy to reverse. POIs near this route might include the Davisville subway station and various shops and restaurants along Yonge Street. The clear street names and relatively simple route give me very high confidence.
