Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route likely involves navigating residential streets and possibly a park trail (Norwood Park Trail).  My confidence is lowered because the multiple short turns suggest a complex route, making precise reversal more challenging without visual confirmation.  I'm assuming the "keep right/left" instructions refer to staying on the main road at slight forks.  Possible POIs near this route could include Norwood Park itself and residential homes along the named streets.
