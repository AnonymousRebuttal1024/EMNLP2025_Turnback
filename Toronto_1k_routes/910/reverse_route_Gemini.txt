Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the Yonge and Eglinton (Midtown) area, beginning near the intersection of Yonge St and Taunton Rd and heading generally south, possibly towards Mount Pleasant Cemetery, based on the coordinates. I am familiar with Yonge Street and the general area.  Taunton Road and Soudan Avenue are useful reference points. However, the several "slight" turns and "keep right/left" instructions make the precise path harder to reconstruct and reverse mentally, hence the somewhat lower confidence.  Potential POIs include Mount Pleasant Cemetery, the shops and restaurants around Yonge and Eglinton, and residential buildings.
