Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route is in a residential area north of Eglinton West, likely near Forest Hill. The coordinates suggest a relatively straight path with a few turns, making it easier to reconstruct the reverse directions.  Belgravia Avenue is a real street in that area and the distances seem plausible for the turns described.  I'm fairly confident about the general street layout, but less certain about the exact angles of "slight right" turns and the existence of small side streets or private driveways that could affect the precise route. Landmarks might include residential buildings, small parks, or perhaps a local school.
