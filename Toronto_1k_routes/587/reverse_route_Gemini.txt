Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the Kensington Market/Chinatown area. The presence of Baldwin Street, Nassau Street, and Alley Cat Lane (a small laneway characteristic of the area) makes me quite confident in the route's location and my reconstruction.  Kensington Market is known for its vibrant street art, vintage clothing stores, and diverse food scene, while Chinatown offers numerous restaurants and shops. These would be prominent landmarks in this area.
