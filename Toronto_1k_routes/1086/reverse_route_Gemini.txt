Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: The mention of the Lake Shore Boulevard Recreational Trail makes the starting point and initial direction clear. This route likely follows the trail eastward, then northward, possibly towards the Beaches neighborhood. While there are many turns after leaving the trail, the initial landmark and the overall pattern of shorter and longer segments helps with a fairly confident reconstruction. POIs are likely related to the waterfront and the beaches, possibly including Ashbridges Bay Park depending on the final destination.
