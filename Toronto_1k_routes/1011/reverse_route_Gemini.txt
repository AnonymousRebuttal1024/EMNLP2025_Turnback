Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route appears to navigate a residential area likely east of the Don Valley Parkway, based on the coordinates.  The numerous turns and short segments suggest a complex route through local streets. While I have a good general understanding of Toronto's road network, particularly the grid pattern and major arteries, the specifics of smaller residential streets are less precise in my internal model.  I am confident about the general westward direction from the destination to the start and the overall sequence of turns, but there might be minor inaccuracies in distances and street names, especially for the smaller streets like Harriet, Bushell, and Myrtle. I can't guarantee these smaller street names are exactly correct without access to a map.  The presence of Leslie Street, a major north-south artery, increases my confidence, as it provides a likely anchor point for the route.
