Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Wexford-Maryvale neighborhood of Scarborough, near the intersection of Victoria Park Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East. O'Connor Drive, Leafy Woodway, Bartley Drive, and Cranborne Avenue are all located in that area. The long 842.4-meter segment likely corresponds to a major road like Eglinton Avenue East.  The presence of these specific street names makes me quite confident about the reversal of directions, although the "sharp" turns and "slight right" introduce a small degree of uncertainty without a visual reference.  Potential landmarks might include residential buildings, the Eglinton Square Shopping Centre, or perhaps a local school.
