Confidence: 75%

This route seems to be in the High Park Swansea neighbourhood, possibly near High Park itself. Evelyn Avenue, Glendonwynne Road, and Quebec Avenue provide some anchor points. However, the many short segments and turns, especially towards the end of the route, reduce my certainty. The exact paths could involve smaller residential streets or lanes that I'm not aware of. High Park would likely be a visible landmark depending on the specific location.
