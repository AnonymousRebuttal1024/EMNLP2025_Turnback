Confidence: 85%

Reason: The route involves several smaller streets and a number of turns, which makes the precise reversal slightly less certain without visual reference. The street names (Harcourt, Carlaw, McConnell, Logan, Langley Avenues) seem plausible for Toronto, but I do not know the exact layout of these smaller streets in relation to each other with absolute certainty.  The distances are reasonable.  The area is likely residential.  POIs would be houses and possibly small local businesses.  The reversal is logically sound, but the lack of absolute certainty about the street network in that specific area lowers the confidence level.
