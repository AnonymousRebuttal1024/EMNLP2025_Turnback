Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Junction Triangle, potentially starting near Dundas West and Runnymede. Pacific Avenue, McMurray Avenue, and Gilmour Avenue are all found in this area.  However, the many turns, "keep left/right," and "slight left/right" instructions make it difficult to be entirely certain without a map. The Junction Triangle has a somewhat irregular street pattern due to railway lines and industrial areas interspersed with residential areas.  Potential POIs might include the shops and restaurants along Dundas West and the nearby parks.
