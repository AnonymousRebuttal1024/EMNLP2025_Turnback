Confidence: 85%

This route is in the Liberty Village area, close to Exhibition Place. I recognize Hanna Avenue and Garrison Crossing as streets within that development.  The mix of longer and shorter segments is typical of the area, with the shorter segments likely navigating around buildings or pedestrian areas.  Exhibition Place, a large venue for events and exhibitions, is a prominent landmark nearby.  The presence of named streets and my understanding of the area's layout increase my confidence.
