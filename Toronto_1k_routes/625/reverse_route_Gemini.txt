Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route likely starts near the intersection of Davenport Road and Dufferin Street and heads northwest. The long stretch on Humewood Drive is a key indicator, as it's a significant residential street in that area.  The other shorter segments likely navigate the residential streets around it. I'm reasonably confident, due to the prominence of Humewood Drive, but the several unnamed turns reduce my certainty slightly.  Possible POIs near the start could be businesses along Davenport or Dufferin.  The destination appears to be in a residential area, perhaps near Humewood Park.
