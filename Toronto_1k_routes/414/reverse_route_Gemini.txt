Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the  Wychwood Park neighborhood near the intersection of St. Clair West and Christie. Oak Park Avenue is a good anchoring point. The numerous turns and varied distances suggest a moderately complex residential route.  Without more context, precise reversal is somewhat challenging. Potential POIs might include Wychwood Barns or the shops and businesses along St. Clair West.
