**Confidence: 85%**

**Reason:** The route involves intricate navigation through various paths including pathways like the Eaton Centre, which requires attention to potential indoor variabilities. While notable streets such as George Street South provide markers, the oscillation between outdoor and indoor segments necessitates structured reversal logic. Given the inherent complexity introduced by escalator transitions and layered centre levels, detailed care aligns the reversals well, ensuring logical coherence and informed corrections throughout, accounting for confident yet meticulous urban molded fidelity.
