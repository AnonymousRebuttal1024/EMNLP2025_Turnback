Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to navigate a residential area, likely near Casa Loma based on the street names (e.g., Wychwood, Kenwood).  The numerous turns suggest a complex route through smaller streets, making it difficult to maintain high confidence without visual confirmation.  The presence of "Lane East Vaughan South Maplewood" suggests a major road intersection, providing an anchor point.  However,  without a map, the accuracy of all the smaller turns and distances is hard to guarantee.  POIs could include Casa Loma, St. Clair West subway station depending on the specific location along Wychwood.
