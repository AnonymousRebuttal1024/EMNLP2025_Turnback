Confidence: 85%

Reasoning:  The presence of Oxford Street and Chinatown Mural Lane strongly suggests this route is in or near Kensington Market/Chinatown.  The "keep left" likely indicates staying on a major road (possibly Spadina Avenue).  The numerous short turns suggest navigating the smaller streets and alleys characteristic of the area. My confidence is high due to these specific landmarks, although the complexity of the route leaves some room for error.  Potential POIs include various shops and restaurants in Chinatown, Kensington Market stalls, art galleries, and graffiti art in the laneways.
