Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: My confidence is 90% because this route includes several named streets (Devonshire Place, Cumberland Street, Yonge Street, Asquith Avenue, Park Road) which act as significant landmarks.  Reversing the turns is fairly straightforward. The presence of these landmarks makes the reversal quite accurate. The only minor source of uncertainty might come from the short segments and the precise interpretation of "slight left" and "sharp right" turns, but the overall accuracy should be high due to the named streets.  The route is long enough and uses major roads to help in the reversal.
