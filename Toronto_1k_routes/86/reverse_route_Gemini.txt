Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route description uses street names that are plausible for Toronto's residential areas, and the distances seem reasonable for city blocks.  The reversal is straightforward.  However, I don't have perfect recall of the exact layout of streets in that specific area, resulting in a slight reduction in confidence.  The area contains mainly residential buildings as POIs. The confidence would be higher if I could visualize the exact intersection locations involved.
