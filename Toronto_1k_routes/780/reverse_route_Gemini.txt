This route appears to be a series of turns forming a roughly rectangular shape, based on the consistent left turns. The coordinates place it close to the University of Toronto and the intersection of Spadina Avenue and College Street. I'm very confident in the reversal, as this type of rectangular route is easy to mirror. The lack of street names makes it slightly harder to pinpoint the exact location, but the general pattern of the turns and distances makes the reversal very straightforward. POIs near this area could include the University of Toronto campus buildings, shops along Spadina Avenue, and restaurants in the Chinatown area.
