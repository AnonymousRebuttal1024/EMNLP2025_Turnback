Confidence: 90%

This area is largely residential with winding streets, making it harder to be 100% certain without visually verifying the route.  However, the street names are distinct, and the turns are well-defined, giving me a high degree of confidence.  Landmarks in the vicinity might include the St. Michael's College School playing fields near the start and the ravine system nearby.
