Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Upper Beaches, likely near Woodbine Avenue based on the coordinates. The combination of shorter and longer segments suggests a mix of residential streets and possibly a section of a larger road. The absence of street names makes it harder to be entirely certain, but the general pattern of movement and the lengths of the segments provide a reasonable basis for the reversal. Potential POIs could include Woodbine Park, the shops and restaurants along Queen Street East, or the residential areas surrounding this route.
