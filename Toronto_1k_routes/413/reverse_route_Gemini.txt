Confidence: 80%

Reasoning:  This route seems to be in the Rosedale neighborhood, possibly near the intersection of Yonge Street and Roxborough St E.  "South Drive", "Dunbar Road", "Elm Avenue", and "Glen Road" are all characteristic of this area.  The long 836.9m segment suggests a major road like Yonge Street or Bayview Avenue. The presence of named streets increases confidence. However, the lack of more detailed information about some of the turns and the presence of several 'keep' instructions introduce some uncertainty. Potential POIs might include Rosedale subway station and the shops and restaurants in the area.
