Confidence: 90%

Reason: The reversal is largely accurate, following the opposite directions. However, the confidence is slightly lower due to the presence of several sharp turns and the specific names of the trails (Rexleigh Gravel Climb, Taylor Creek Trail, Taylor Creek Hydro Corridor, Lumsden Climb) which might have slight variations in their exact paths.  The long stretches of "Keep Left" and the numerous sharp turns make precise reversal slightly less certain without visual confirmation. The area seems to be near a creek with walking/biking trails, suggesting a park-like setting. The mention of Eastdale Avenue suggests a nearby residential area.
