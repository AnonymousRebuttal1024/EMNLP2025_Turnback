Confidence: 65%

Explanation: This route is extremely complex with a large number of turns, including several "slight" and "sharp" turns. The coordinates suggest a location in the west end, possibly near Dufferin Grove Park and the Bloor GO/UP station area. While I'm familiar with the general area, the sheer number of turns and the lack of major street names make it very difficult to mentally reconstruct and reverse with accuracy.  Barton Avenue and Montrose Avenue help to anchor the route, but the many small turns and segments in between significantly reduce my confidence.  POIs could include residential areas, Dufferin Grove Park itself, and perhaps smaller businesses along Bloor Street West.
