Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route appears to start near the downtown core, likely close to Yonge and Dundas, and head northeast towards the Church and Wellesley area based on the coordinates and street names (George, Gerrard, Horticultural). I'm familiar with these streets and the general area. The numerous turns, including "keep right/left" instructions, make it difficult to precisely reconstruct in my mind, reducing my confidence somewhat. POIs could include Ryerson University, the Toronto Metropolitan University campus, the Church and Wellesley Village with its LGBTQ+ focused businesses, and various restaurants and shops along Yonge Street.
