**Confidence: 90%**

**Reason:** The path is relatively direct and includes several consecutive long stretches, which makes reversal logic fairly straightforward. Named streets such as Broadcast Lane and Arthur Goss Lane help ensure accurate orientation. Minor adjustments with slight right/left turns were handled carefully to ensure accuracy, despite being reversed, leading to high confidence in this sequence, balancing path precision with potential urban navigation complexity.
