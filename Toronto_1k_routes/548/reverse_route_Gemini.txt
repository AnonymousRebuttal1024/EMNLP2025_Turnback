Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the West Queen West area, potentially near Trinity Bellwoods Park and the Fashion District. Street names like Crawford, Shaw, and Hallam, as well as the small lane "Sandra Shamas Lane," suggest this area. The presence of "Lane South Dupont East Delaware" suggests a location near Dupont Street. I'm fairly confident (80%) in the reversal, particularly the segments involving named streets. However, the smaller unnamed streets and lanes introduce some uncertainty, as I cannot be entirely sure of their exact configuration without a map. Possible POIs include residential buildings, trendy shops and restaurants along Queen Street West, and potentially some art galleries or studios.
