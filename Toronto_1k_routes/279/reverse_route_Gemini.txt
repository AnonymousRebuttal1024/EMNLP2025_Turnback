The relatively few turns make this route fairly straightforward to reverse.  The lack of street names makes it a bit more challenging to be completely certain. Based on the coordinates, this is in the North York area, possibly near a park or residential neighborhood given the turns. Without street names, pinpointing landmarks is difficult, but there might be local parks, schools, or community centers in the vicinity.
