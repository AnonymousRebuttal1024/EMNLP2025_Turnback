Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the Cabbagetown neighborhood, based on the street names (Sackville, Power, Berkeley) and coordinates. I'm familiar with the general layout of that area, although the specific turns within the smaller streets make me slightly less certain. I'm confident about the main streets involved, and reversing the general direction is straightforward. POIs near this area include Riverdale Farm, the Wellesley subway station, and various restaurants and shops along Parliament Street, which is likely close by.  The presence of Power Street and Sackville Street also suggests proximity to residential areas with Victorian architecture.
