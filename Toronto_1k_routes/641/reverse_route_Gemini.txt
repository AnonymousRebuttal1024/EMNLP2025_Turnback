Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route appears to start near the intersection of The Queensway and Roncesvalles Ave. Beaty Avenue is a good starting landmark. The route seems to head generally east.  The longer 367.4m segment likely follows a major east-west road, possibly The Queensway itself. The absence of other named streets makes precise visualization tricky, and the “keep” instructions suggest some curves or bends. My confidence is moderate; the named starting street helps, but the lack of other named streets makes it harder to be completely sure of the reversed path.  Potential POIs might include businesses along The Queensway, or residential buildings, given that the area is mostly residential.
