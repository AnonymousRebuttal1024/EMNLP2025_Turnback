Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Wychwood neighbourhood, potentially near Casa Loma.  The longer stretches suggest it involves arterial roads like Davenport Road or Spadina Road. I'm fairly confident about the overall direction and the longer segments, though the exact placement of shorter segments and turns (like the 9.6m and 21.8m sections) are less certain without street names. Casa Loma or Nordheimer Ravine could be potential landmarks.
