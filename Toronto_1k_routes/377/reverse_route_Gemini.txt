Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route seems to start near Dundas Street West and Sterling Road, heading west and then generally north. The West Toronto Railpath is a key landmark, along with Humberside Avenue and Indian Grove.  I'm fairly confident about the sections along those named paths and streets.  The several "Keep Right/Left" instructions suggest navigating along curves or forks, likely on the railpath itself, which might be slightly different in reality. Potential POIs include the railpath itself (a popular walking and cycling route), the Dundas West shopping and restaurant strip, and residential areas in the Junction Triangle.
