**Reason:** The navigational instructions involve well-defined, mostly linear routes with relatively few turns, supported by structured turns at specific intervals. This straightforward sequence simplifies directional tasks for reversal, ensuring coherence throughout the pathway. Logical flow and consistency are maintained through explicit steps, which fortifies confidence in capturing all transition points correctly across urban dynamic areas where clear alignment is indicated.
