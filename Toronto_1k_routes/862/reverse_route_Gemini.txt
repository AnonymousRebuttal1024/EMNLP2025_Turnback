Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: Fleet Street and Nunavut Road offer decent landmarks. However, the abundance of "slight" turns, short segments, and "keep right/left" instructions makes precise reversal quite challenging. This kind of route requires good visual cues to navigate accurately, and therefore my confidence is lowered.  The area seems to be primarily residential, perhaps near the Exhibition Place or Liberty Village, judging by the coordinates and my general knowledge of Toronto. Potential POIs might include residential buildings, some small businesses, and maybe a park, but it's difficult to be more specific given the lack of cross streets or very distinctive landmarks.
