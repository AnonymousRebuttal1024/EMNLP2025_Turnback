Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: Bayview Heights Drive, Nesbitt Drive, Edgewood Crescent, and Glen Road provide a good framework for reversing the route. The "keep left" instruction likely refers to staying on the main road at a fork. The "sharp right" adds some complexity, but the named streets increase my confidence. Potential POIs could include residential buildings along the named streets, possibly a park or ravine area considering the winding nature of some sections, and perhaps a school or community center. The Bayview name suggests this area could be in the north-central part of Toronto near the Don Valley, which aligns with my knowledge of the city's geography.
