Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: D'Arcy Street, Renfrew Place, and Duncan Street provide some useful landmarks. However, the very high number of turns, including multiple short segments and a "slight right", significantly reduces confidence in accurate reversal. This complex route requires local knowledge for precise backtracking. Potential POIs are difficult to ascertain without more context, but given the area (likely near Kensington Market/Chinatown based on previous routes and the street names), possibilities include residential buildings, small independent businesses, and cafes.
