Explanation: The route likely navigates a downtown or central Toronto area, distinguished by a mix of straight and complex turn sequences, as depicted by streets involved. Inherent to urban settings with crowded intersections and close-knit avenues, achieving accurate navigation through a string of simple turns promotes a largely predictable retracing experience. While requiring attention to sharper transitions, the route remains feasible through closely aligned street orderings standard to downtown Toronto formats, implying promising reverse operation across layered Toronto channels.
