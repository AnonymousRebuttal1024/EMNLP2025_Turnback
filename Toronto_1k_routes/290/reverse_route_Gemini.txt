Confidence: 75%

Reasoning:  This route is likely in the Entertainment District/King West area. Niagara Street is a key street in this area, and the route seems to navigate around some of the smaller streets and possibly parking areas near the railway tracks.  The initial eastward direction, combined with the turn onto Niagara, is a good starting point, but the numerous short segments and turns, especially around Brunel Court, introduce uncertainty without a visual map.  Potential POIs in the vicinity could include the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, Rogers Centre, and various hotels and entertainment venues.
