Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: The starting point being on a lane suggests a residential area. The "Lane South Eglinton West Dufferin" is quite helpful, indicating a location near Eglinton West and Dufferin Street.  The long, slightly curving segment of 678.7 meters is the main part of the route, likely following a major road or a curving path.  The remaining turns and shorter distances are likely residential streets or smaller paths.  I'm fairly confident in the reverse directions, but the "slight left" and "keep left" instructions introduce some uncertainty as they might represent curves rather than distinct turns.  This area likely close to Allenby.
