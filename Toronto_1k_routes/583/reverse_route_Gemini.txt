Confidence: 85%

This route appears to go from the Kensington Market area eastward towards the Entertainment District, ending near Simcoe Street.  The inclusion of several street names like Brunswick Avenue, Ulster Street, Major Street, Grimsby Dairy Lane, Robert Street, Baldwin Street and Simcoe Street helps significantly in reconstructing the route.  Landmarks along this route could include the shops and restaurants of Kensington Market, the AGO (Art Gallery of Ontario), and various theaters and entertainment venues closer to Simcoe Street.  While the numerous turns make the route complex, the street names provide strong anchors. I am a bit less confident about the unnamed segments, and my interpretation of "sharp right" and "slight left" involves some assumptions.
