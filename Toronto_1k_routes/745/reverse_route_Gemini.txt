Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Parkdale/Roncesvalles Village area, west of downtown Toronto, close to Sunnyside Park on the lakeshore. Sunnyside Avenue and Wright Avenue offer good anchor points. While the initial set of short turns adds some complexity, the longer stretch on Wright Avenue helps with orientation. Potential landmarks nearby could include Sunnyside Park, the waterfront trail along Lake Ontario, or the Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion.
