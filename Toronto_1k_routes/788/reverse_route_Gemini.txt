This route seems to be located in the Yonge and Eglinton/Mount Pleasant area,  given the coordinates and the street names Banff Road, Roehampton Avenue, Rowley Avenue and Glenavy Avenue. These street names provide a reasonable anchor.  Multiple "keep left/right" instructions suggest curves or slight bends which can be a bit ambiguous. The short segments also introduce some uncertainty, but overall, the reversal should be fairly accurate. Possible POIs might include the parks in the area like Eglinton Park or businesses along Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue.
