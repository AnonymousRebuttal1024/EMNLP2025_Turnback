Confidence: 85%

This route is relatively complex with numerous turns.  However, the distinct changes in direction and varying distances provide a reasonable basis for reversal. The "sharp right" offers a helpful landmark. The lack of street names lowers my confidence somewhat, as it's harder to be certain of the precise location and surrounding landmarks.  Based on the coordinates, this route seems to traverse the area east of the downtown core, possibly near the Distillery District or Leslieville. Potential landmarks could include parks, industrial buildings, or smaller businesses.
