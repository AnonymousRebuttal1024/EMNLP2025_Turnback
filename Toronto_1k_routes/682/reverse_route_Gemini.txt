This route appears to be in the Upper Beaches neighbourhood, possibly near the intersection of Kingston Road and Main Street.  The relatively few steps and longer distances suggest it uses major or collector streets. While I don't have specific street names, the simple nature of the route makes the reversal straightforward and fairly accurate.  Potential landmarks might include shops along Kingston Road, residential buildings, or potentially even glimpses of Lake Ontario depending on the precise location.
