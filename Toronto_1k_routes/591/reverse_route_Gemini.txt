This route seems to be in the Leslieville/Riverdale area, starting near Carlaw Avenue and heading east towards the Don Valley Parkway and the Eastern Avenue Connector. The inclusion of Carlaw Avenue, the Eastern Avenue Connector, and Lawren Harris Square provides good anchoring points. "Sharp left" is translated to "slight right", assuming a gentler turn in reverse. This area is undergoing significant redevelopment with a mix of older industrial buildings, newer residential developments, and some parkland associated with the Don River.  Potential landmarks could include the Leslieville Farmers' Market, the Jimmie Simpson Recreation Centre, and the Don Valley ravine system.
