**Confidence: 95%**

**Reason:** The path involves distinct segments with straightforward where the actions inverses—turns and straightforward distances—are paired with recognizable sequences. As the navigation consists of predominantly deterministic directional shifts, retracing is structured and systematic within the context of directionality and instruction type. The minimal complexity or variability potential supports strong confidence in this route reversal.
