Confidence: 80%

Reason: The route involves several short segments and less-known lane names (Thomas McClintock Lane and Antonios Mavrakakis Lane). While the directions are straightforward to reverse, the lack of familiarity with these specific lanes reduces my confidence.  The reversal is logically consistent with the forward directions.  I don't have specific POI information for these smaller lanes; they appear to be in a denser urban area.  The overall plausibility of the route and the logical reversal leads to an 80% confidence.
