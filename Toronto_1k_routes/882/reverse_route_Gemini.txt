Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route appears to be in Etobicoke, south of Bloor Street West and likely west of Kipling Avenue, based on the coordinates. The route involves numerous "keep left/right" instructions, which introduce uncertainty when reversing as it is hard to know the exact configuration of the road or path. The "slight" turns also make precise reversal difficult. I'm somewhat familiar with the general area, but not the specific smaller streets likely involved, lowering my overall confidence.  Potential POIs could include residential areas, parks, and possibly some retail locations along Bloor Street or Kipling Avenue.
