Confidence: 70%

This route seems to be near the Stock Yards Village shopping area, west of Keele Street and St. Clair Avenue West.  Old Stock Yards Road confirms this general vicinity. The numerous short segments, "Keep Left/Right" instructions, and turns indicate a complex route potentially incorporating parking lot navigation, pedestrian walkways, or smaller access roads within the commercial area.  This complexity reduces my confidence in the precise accuracy of the reversed directions.
