Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route is in the Annex neighbourhood, a relatively grid-like area.  I am familiar with the major streets like Palmerston, Euclid, and Crawford. The existence of Trinity Circle adds a bit of complexity, but the instructions are clear enough to reconstruct the reverse route with reasonable confidence.  I am slightly less certain about the smaller turns and unnamed roads, as those are harder to visualize without a map.  Potential POIs near this route include Trinity Bellwoods Park.
