Confidence: 98%

Reasoning:  The reversal is highly confident due to the relatively straightforward, sequential nature of the turns. The street names are all clearly identifiable, and their relative positions are accurately reflected in the reversed directions. The only potential for minor error comes from the precise measurements of shorter segments, but the overall route integrity remains strong. The area is residential, so there aren't major landmarks directly on the route, but it's located near the Don River.
