Confidence: 95%

Donlands Avenue provides a good starting point, and the relatively few turns, combined with a long straight segment (964.7 meters, likely a section of Danforth Avenue), make me quite confident in the reversal. This area is likely a mix of residential and commercial properties, typical of the Danforth area. Potential landmarks might include shops and restaurants along the Danforth, or residential buildings on nearby streets.
