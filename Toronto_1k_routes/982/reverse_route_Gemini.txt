Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the York University Heights area, possibly near the York University campus. I'm reasonably familiar with the street layout in that area, and the combination of longer and shorter segments suggests a plausible walking route. Ancaster Road and Regent Road sound like residential streets that might be found near the campus. The long 577.3-meter segment might be along a major road like Finch Avenue West. While I lack specific landmarks for this route, my familiarity with the general area makes me reasonably confident.
