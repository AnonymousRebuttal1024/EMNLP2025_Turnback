Confidence: 70%

This route appears to be in the Warden and Ellesmere area, likely near Warden Woods park.  Cleanside and Ayers Crescent are residential streets. My confidence is lowered because the input directions include some very short segments (e.g., 6.2 meters, 7.2 meters), which makes me think the actual pedestrian path might be slightly different from the road network I have in mind. Also, the initial and final short segments (53.3m and 86.1m) make me wonder if the start and endpoints are precisely on the road or slightly offset, perhaps representing a driveway or walkway.
