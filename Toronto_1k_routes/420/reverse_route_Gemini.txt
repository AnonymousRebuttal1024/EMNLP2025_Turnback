Confidence: 65%

Reasoning: This route seems to originate near Woodbine and Kingston Road, traversing through residential streets and potentially involving some turns near or within the Beaches neighborhood before proceeding along what is likely a segment of the Martin Goodman Trail (given the lengths and the context of other routes). It eventually reaches what appears to be Upper Beaches area, as indicated by the presence of Lee Avenue, Norway Avenue, and Elmer Avenue - names that have appeared in earlier route queries, suggesting a familiar area. The significant number of turns, some of which are on unnamed roads or involve "keep right/left" instructions, coupled with varying distances, makes it a complex route to reverse solely based on textual descriptions. Hence, the confidence is lower.  Potential POIs might include local parks near the beginning, the Beaches boardwalk if it's close to the starting point, and perhaps shops and eateries along Queen East as the route progresses westward.
