Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route seems to follow a fairly straight path initially, suggested by the long "keep left" instructions. The presence of Queen Street East and Pape Avenue as landmarks, and Boston Avenue near the destination, greatly increases confidence. This area is likely in Leslieville or Riverdale, based on those street names.  The shorter segments at the end likely represent local streets.  The relatively clear overall west-to-east trajectory also contributes to my confidence.
