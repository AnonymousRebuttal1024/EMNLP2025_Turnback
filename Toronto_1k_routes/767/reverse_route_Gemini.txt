Confidence: 80%

Reasoning:  This route seems to start near Queen and Greenwood and head northeast towards Pape and Danforth. Logan Avenue is a prominent street, and its presence greatly increases my confidence. "Busy Street" is likely an unnamed smaller street.  While the beginning has a few short, unnamed segments, the long stretch on Logan Avenue provides a good directional anchor. Potential landmarks could include the Jimmie Simpson Recreation Centre or the shops along Queen Street East.
