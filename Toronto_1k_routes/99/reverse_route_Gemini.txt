Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route is relatively straightforward, involving a sequence of turns that seem plausible for a residential area of Toronto.  The mention of Avon Avenue provides a landmark. The distances are reasonable.  The reversal is easy to follow.  However, without knowing the exact layout of the smaller streets near Avon Avenue, there is a small margin of error possible, which is why the confidence is not 100%.  POIs in the area are likely to be houses and perhaps small businesses.
