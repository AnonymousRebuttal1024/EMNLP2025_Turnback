Explanation: The route traverses residential parts of Toronto, likely navigating through connected streets in Parkdale or near Roncesvalles, areas known for fairly tight residential grids. The sequence involves numerous quick turns and transitional paths along smaller roads like Fermanagh Avenue and Wright Avenue. The intricacy of navigating these tightly-knit city segments challenges precise tracking for path reversal, although the organized urban grid layout aids overall navigation. The involved sequence of minor turns requires careful adherence, but identifiable streets and Toronto's predictable street patterns bring reasonable adherence to the path recovery process.
