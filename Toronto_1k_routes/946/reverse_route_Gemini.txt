Confidence: 80%

Reasoning:  This route is in the area of Leslieville/South Riverdale, just north of Lake Shore Boulevard East.  Vancouver Avenue provides a solid starting point. The route seems to head towards the waterfront and involves a section along the Martin Goodman Trail/Lake Shore Boulevard Recreational Trail, a popular multi-use path. The numerous turns suggest navigating through smaller residential streets before reaching the waterfront path. I'm reasonably confident in the general area and the parts along the major streets/trails, but less sure about the smaller segments and the accuracy of "sharp" turns without a visual reference. Potential landmarks along or near this route include residential buildings, Jimmie Simpson Park, and the waterfront itself.
