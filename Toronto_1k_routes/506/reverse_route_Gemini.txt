Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in a residential area, likely with some curving streets or paths, given the "slight" and "sharp" turns, and the multiple short segments.  The absence of named streets makes it harder to pinpoint the location, but the overall change in coordinates suggests a south to roughly southwest movement. I'm making some assumptions about how "sharp" and "slight" turns reverse, which adds uncertainty. This is likely in the west of Toronto in Etobicoke, where there are a number of residential neighborhoods without major streets running through them. I'm reasonably confident, but the lack of landmarks decreases the certainty.
