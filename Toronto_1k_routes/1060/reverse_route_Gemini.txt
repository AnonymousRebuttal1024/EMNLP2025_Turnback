Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: The inclusion of street names like Sheridan Avenue, Awde Street and Fisher Street helps significantly, placing the route in the Roncesvalles neighborhood near High Park. I am reasonably confident about the reversal, especially given the landmarks provided. However, the numerous small turns and short distances make it possible that minor errors could exist, especially in the residential sections between the named streets. The area is known for its winding streets and somewhat irregular layout. Possible POIs in the vicinity are High Park itself, the shops and restaurants along Roncesvalles Avenue, and the various smaller businesses in the neighborhood.
