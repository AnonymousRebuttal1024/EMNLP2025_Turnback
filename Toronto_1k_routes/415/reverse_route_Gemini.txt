Confidence: 85%

Reasoning:  This route appears to be in the Rockcliffe-Smythe neighborhood, likely west of Jane Street and south of Eglinton Avenue West, based on the presence of street names like Braga Gardens and Sagres Crescent.  The long 943.8m segment suggests a major road like Jane Street or Rockcliffe Blvd. The relatively few turns increase confidence in the reversal. However, the lack of other major landmarks makes it hard to be entirely certain. Potential POIs could include the shops along Jane St, or perhaps a local park.
