Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be in the Lawrence Park area, with the specific mention of Glengrove Avenue West and Mona Drive. Richard Denis Way is likely a small side street.  Given the relatively few turns and the specified street names, I have high confidence (90%) in the accuracy of the reversed directions.  This area is primarily residential, so likely POIs would include houses, possibly a parkette, and perhaps some local businesses on nearby Yonge Street or Lawrence Avenue.
