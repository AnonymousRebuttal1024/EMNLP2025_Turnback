This route seems to be in the Junction Triangle, west of Lansdowne Avenue.  The longer stretches and fewer turns suggest following main roads for portions of the journey, possibly Dupont Street or Bloor Street West. The lack of specific street names makes precise location identification difficult.  The two "sharp" turns likely indicate significant changes in direction, though their exact angles are unclear, and I've translated them as "slight" turns in the reverse.  Without street names, landmarks are harder to pinpoint, but the Junction Triangle area has a mix of residential and industrial areas, with some parks and green spaces.
