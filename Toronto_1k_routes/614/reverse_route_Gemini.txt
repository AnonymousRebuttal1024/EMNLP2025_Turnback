Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Beach neighborhood, east of Woodbine Avenue. The presence of Osborne Avenue and Swanwick Avenue is a strong indicator of the location.  The mix of shorter and longer segments indicates navigating local streets and possibly a main road. I'm quite confident about the reverse directions due to the street names, although the unnamed initial/final steps and the interpretation of slight turns and keeps introduces a small amount of uncertainty. Potential landmarks in this area would include residential buildings, the shops and restaurants along Queen Street East, and the beaches along Lake Ontario.
