Confidence: 75%

This route appears to be in the  Yorkdale/Glen Park area, judging by the presence of Dufferin Street, Lauder Avenue, Northcliffe Boulevard, and Eversfield Road. The many short segments and turns suggest a residential area with a relatively complex street layout.  My confidence is 75%. While the named streets give me a reasonable idea of the location, the numerous turns make it harder to be precise without a visual aid.  I'm unsure about the precise configuration of smaller streets and potential one-way restrictions.  Likely POIs near this route would include residential homes, and potentially some businesses along Dufferin Street.
