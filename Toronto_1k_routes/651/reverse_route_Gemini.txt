Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the Yonge and Eglinton (midtown) area. Manor Road East, Tullis Drive, and Imperial Street are helpful landmarks for that area. The short segments and frequent turns suggest navigating residential streets or laneways.  The 271.7m segment on Tullis Drive is a decent length, but the lack of more prominent, longer roads makes visualizing the entire route in reverse somewhat challenging. My confidence is moderate, as the named streets give a good general location, but the numerous turns and short segments make it hard to be completely precise. Potential POIs might include residential buildings, perhaps a small park, or businesses along Yonge Street, which is likely a short distance west of this route.
