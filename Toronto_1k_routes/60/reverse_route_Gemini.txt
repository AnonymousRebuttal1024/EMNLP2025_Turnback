Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route appears to navigate through a residential area possibly near Bloor Street based on the length of one of the segments.  I've inferred likely street layouts and turns.  My confidence isn't 100% because without street names, there might be slight variations or one-way streets that could impact the reverse directions.  For instance, the "keep right/left" instructions are a little ambiguous in reverse without knowing the precise road configuration.  The area likely has some shops and residential buildings along Bloor, and possibly parks or schools nearby given the turns and distances.
