Confidence: 90%

The presence of Balsam Avenue and Hannaford Street, combined with the detailed turns, gives me high confidence.  "Sharp left" and "slight left" add specificity, although there's always some minor uncertainty with such terms. This area is likely residential, possibly with a mix of houses and smaller apartment buildings, given the turns and street names. This area is in Greektown/Riverdale. Potential landmarks might include local shops on Danforth Avenue, Withrow Park, or residential buildings.
