Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the Dovercourt-Wallace Emerson-Junction area, west of Bathurst Street and likely south of Bloor Street West.  The presence of Morse Street and Thompson Street helps to anchor the location. Joel Weeks Park and its trail is a key landmark. The numerous turns and varying distances suggest a mix of residential streets and potentially some park paths.  I'm fairly confident about the reversal, especially with the street and park trail names, but there's some uncertainty with the initial and final "head" instructions and the interpretation of "keep right" and "slight right."  The proximity to Joel Weeks Park suggests recreational facilities and green spaces as potential landmarks.
