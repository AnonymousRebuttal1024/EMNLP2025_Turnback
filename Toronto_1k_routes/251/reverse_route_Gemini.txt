Confidence: 95%

The presence of street names (Cheritan Avenue, Rosewell Avenue, Glenview Avenue, Briar Hill Avenue, Roselawn Avenue) and the roundabout provide clear markers, giving me high confidence in the reversal. The roundabout instruction is particularly helpful.  This area appears residential, likely with a mix of houses and potentially some low-rise apartments. This route is in the north-central part of Toronto, near the Yorkdale area.  Possible landmarks could include schools, local parks, or small businesses along the named avenues.
