Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route likely starts near University Avenue and Queen Street West and heads west towards the University of Toronto campus. Willcocks Street is a good anchor point, placing the destination in the heart of the campus. The multiple short segments, "keep left/right," and "slight right/left" instructions suggest a winding path through the campus, which makes precise reversal challenging without a map. Potential POIs near this route could include University College, Hart House, and various other university buildings.
