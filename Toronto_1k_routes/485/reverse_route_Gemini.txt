Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: This is a relatively simple route dominated by a long stretch along Pacific Avenue.  The start and end points are primarily offset in longitude, suggesting an east/west dominant direction, confirmed by the initial "Head East." Pacific Avenue serves as a strong anchor.  The short segments at the beginning and end are likely connecting streets or driveways.  The simplicity of the route makes me highly confident in the reversed directions. This is likely in the Bloor West Village or Junction Triangle area.
