Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is in the Wychwood neighborhood, likely just south of St. Clair West. Street names like Lightbourn, Brandon, and Foundry are specific to this area and aid in reconstructing the path. The relatively few turns and specified street names increase my confidence. Potential landmarks might include residential homes, the Wychwood Barns park, or small businesses along St. Clair West.
