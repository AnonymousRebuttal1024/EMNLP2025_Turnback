Reasoning: This route is quite straightforward, primarily following Silverthorn Avenue. The starting point is likely in the Rockcliffe-Smythe neighborhood,  potentially near the intersection of Eglinton West and Keele/Rogers Rd. The long stretch along Silverthorn Avenue, and the clear turns, makes it relatively easy to reverse accurately.  Possible POIs might include the shops along Eglinton Avenue West.  The simplicity of the route gives me high confidence in the reverse directions.
