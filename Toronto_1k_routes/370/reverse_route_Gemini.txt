Explanation: This route appears to be in the western part of the downtown core, possibly near the Exhibition Place or the Liberty Village area.  The lack of street names makes it more challenging, and the "sharp left" turns suggest navigating around buildings or along non-standard intersections.  I'm assuming it's a relatively direct path, but without more context, it's harder to be precise.  Potential POIs might include Exhibition Place venues, parks along the waterfront, or residential and commercial buildings in Liberty Village.
