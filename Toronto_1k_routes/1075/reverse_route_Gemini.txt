Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: The inclusion of Vantage Lane and Blossomfield Drive helps to locate the route near the intersection of Jane Street and Finch Avenue West.  This area is residential, with several smaller streets. While the street names provide anchor points, the several turns without named streets introduce some uncertainty, especially given the lack of readily identifiable landmarks in the original instructions. I am reasonably confident in the longer stretches along Blossomfield and the later portion of the route, but less so about the initial and middle parts. Potential POIs are limited in this residential area, possibly a local park or small plaza depending on the exact route.
