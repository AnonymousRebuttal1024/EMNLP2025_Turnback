Reasoning: This route is in the Cabbagetown/Riverdale area, near the Don Valley, using Winchester Street, Riverdale Park, and River Street as key references.  The Don Valley trails and paths ("Downtown Downhill," "River Street Trail") make it somewhat tricky to reverse precisely, as these paths can be winding. The many turns also add complexity. Potential landmarks include Riverdale Park East and the Don Valley Parkway.
