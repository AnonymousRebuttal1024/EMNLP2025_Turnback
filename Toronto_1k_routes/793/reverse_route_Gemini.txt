This route starts near Ryerson Avenue and heads generally east, likely towards the Don Valley and the area near the Distillery District given the coordinates. The very long 1682.7-meter segment suggests a major road like Gerrard Street East or Dundas Street East.  The shorter segments likely represent smaller streets and intersections. The "keep left/right" instructions are a little ambiguous but probably indicate slight bends in the road. The presence of Ryerson Avenue and Ace Lane as landmarks helps anchor the route. POIs might include the Distillery District, or if it goes near Gerrard, then Allan Gardens.
