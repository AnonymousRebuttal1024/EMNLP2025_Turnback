This route appears to be in the Forest Hill Village area. I recognize Vesta Drive, Bilton Lane, Montclair Avenue, and Heath Street West as residential streets in that neighborhood. The relatively long segment on Heath Street West is a good indicator. The shorter segments and turns suggest navigation through the residential streets. This area is primarily residential with larger homes and likely has mature trees and a relatively quiet atmosphere.
