Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route is within and around Exhibition Place, as indicated by Stadium Road and Bishop Tutu Boulevard.  Fleet Street also helps to place the route. While the sequence of short turns at the beginning is a little less certain, the longer stretches and the named roads provide good anchor points.  My mental map of Exhibition Place, while not perfect, gives me reasonable confidence in this reversal. Potential landmarks include BMO Field and the various exhibition buildings.
