**Confidence: 90%**

**Reason:** The confidence in these instructions is higher due to the structured nature of the route involving several right and left turns rather consistently. Notable paths such as Veterans Hill Trail and Raab Boulevard provide clear segment divisions for understanding the route. The predominance of identifiable road names and segments pushes confidence higher, although some uncertainty is always possible with possible local deviations or temporary road closure. Overall, the logic alignment and identifiable reversals (left becoming right and vice versa, while observing more complex maneuvers like a sharp left) solidify the confidence level.
