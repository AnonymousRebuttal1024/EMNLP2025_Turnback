Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route seems to navigate through a residential area, based on the short distances and turns. Street names like Rutland Street and Laughton Avenue provide good reference points, and suggest this is likely in the Swansea/High Park area of Toronto. The sequence of turns suggests a roughly rectangular path. I'm quite confident about the reverse directions, as the turns are relatively unambiguous.  The "keep right" instruction is a minor source of uncertainty, but the overall structure of the route is clear.
