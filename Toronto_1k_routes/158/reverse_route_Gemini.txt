Confidence: 98%

Reason: The route is relatively straightforward despite the numerous turns. Reversing the steps is easy, and the distances are plausible.  The lack of street names makes precise geographic placement difficult, but the directional instructions are clear and unambiguous, leading to high confidence in the accuracy of the reversed route. The route is probably within a residential or less-densely developed area of Toronto, given the lack of prominent street names.
