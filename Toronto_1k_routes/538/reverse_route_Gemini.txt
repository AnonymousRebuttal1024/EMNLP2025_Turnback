Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Annex neighborhood, possibly near Dupont Street and Bathurst Street. Bernard Avenue is a residential street in that area. The combination of shorter and longer segments suggests a mix of residential streets and possibly a small arterial road. My confidence is 85% as I believe the reversal is generally accurate, but without a map, I cannot be absolutely certain about the presence of one-way streets or other minor road features that could require adjustments. Potential POIs near this route could include residential homes, small businesses along Dupont or Bathurst, and possibly a nearby park or school.
