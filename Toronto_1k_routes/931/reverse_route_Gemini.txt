Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Agincourt area of Scarborough, close to the intersection of Kennedy Road and Sheppard Avenue, based on my knowledge of Toronto's street network. Trophy Drive is a street in that area, which gives me more confidence. The relatively few turns and the presence of Trophy Drive makes it easier to reverse the directions. Potential landmarks might include residential homes, the Agincourt Mall to the east, or the Agincourt GO station slightly to the west.
