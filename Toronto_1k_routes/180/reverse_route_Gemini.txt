Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route is relatively short and simple, but the numerous sharp turns and lack of street names make precise reversal slightly less certain.  While I can confidently reverse the directions, the precise angles of the sharp turns and the short distances could result in slight deviations from the original route when followed in reverse.  I have no landmark to help confirm this route in Toronto.
