Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be in the Junction Triangle area, given the mention of the West Toronto Railpath and Osler Street. The Railpath is a distinct landmark in this area, a converted railway line now used as a pedestrian and cycling path. This gives me high confidence (90%) in the general area and the reversal of the route along the Railpath itself. The other streets are likely residential. I'm a bit less certain about the smaller streets connecting to the Railpath, so minor adjustments might be necessary on the ground. Possible POIs near this route would include the businesses and parks springing up along the Railpath, as well as residential housing in the surrounding area.  Pelham Avenue is likely a residential street.
