Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Upper Beaches neighborhood, near the intersection of Kingston Road and Victoria Park Avenue.  St. Bede's Road, Glenburn Avenue, Selwyn Avenue, and Gardens Crescent all suggest this area. The numerous turns and the mix of longer and shorter segments make the exact reversal somewhat challenging from memory, though.  Potential landmarks could include the shops along Kingston Road or the nearby ravine system.
