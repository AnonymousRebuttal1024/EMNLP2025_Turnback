Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route likely starts near Dufferin Grove Park and heads east toward Lansdowne Avenue.  Fermanagh Avenue, Wright Avenue,  Lansdowne Avenue, and St. Clarens Avenue are all real streets in this area, confirming the general location.  However, the many short segments, turns, and "keep left/right" instructions make it tricky to be absolutely precise about the reverse route without a map. POIs could include Dufferin Mall, Dufferin Grove Park, and various businesses along Lansdowne.
