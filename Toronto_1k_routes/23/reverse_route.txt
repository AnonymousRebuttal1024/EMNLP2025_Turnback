**Confidence: 90%**

**Reason:** This route involves clear directional shifts and named streets like Power Street and Davies Avenue, which provide distinct points for confirming correct reversals. The sequence of turns, including sharp turns, slight rights, and the use of clear action words (e.g., "keep left/right"), gives structure to the navigation reversal, maintaining high reliability. Some complexity arises from the close distances and keeping instructions, but overall, these directions have been systematically reversed with clear urban navigational logic.
