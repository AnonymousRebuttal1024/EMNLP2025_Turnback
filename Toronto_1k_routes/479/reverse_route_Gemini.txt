Confidence: 65%

Reasoning:  This is a very complex route with a large number of turns, suggesting navigation through a dense urban area with potentially small blocks and alleys.  The presence of street names like Colgate Avenue, Logan Avenue, and West Avenue helps, but the large number of unnamed turns decreases my confidence.  I'm assuming that "turn slight right/left" reverses to "turn slight right/left" in the opposite direction, which may not always be accurate.  This route likely goes through a residential neighborhood possibly west of downtown, based on the street names.  The initial long westbound leg and the final eastbound leg provide anchors, but the complex middle section is hard to reconstruct with high confidence. I'd guess this area might be near Little Portugal or Parkdale, but I'm less certain than the previous examples.
