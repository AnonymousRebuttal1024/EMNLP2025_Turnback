Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: My confidence is 95% because this route uses named streets (Cordella Avenue, Cliff Street, Alliance Avenue) as landmarks, providing clear reference points for reversal. The directions are relatively simple to reverse, and the distances are manageable.  The only potential source of error might be minor variations in the real-world distances due to the imprecision of my mental model of this part of Toronto, but overall, the named streets allow for highly accurate reversal.
