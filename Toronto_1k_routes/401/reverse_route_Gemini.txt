Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route likely starts near the Don Valley Parkway and Lawrence Avenue East, possibly in a residential area bordering the Don Valley ravine. Cottonwood Drive suggests a residential street, and the other turns indicate navigation through smaller roads. The 494.3m and 427.1m segments likely represent slightly larger collector roads.  While the longer segments provide some anchor points, the lack of other named streets and presence of several turns reduce the confidence somewhat. Potential POIs could include the Don Valley ravine trails or parks if they're nearby.
