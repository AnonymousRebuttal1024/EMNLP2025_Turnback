Confidence: 70%

This route appears to be in or near Trinity Bellwoods park, given the mention of Bellwoods Avenue and streets like Manning and Clinton that are in that area. The small lanes (Scarfo Lane, Frank Kovac Lane) and frequent turns suggest a dense, possibly mixed residential/commercial area. My confidence is around 70%. I'm familiar with the general layout of this area, but without a map, I can't be totally sure about the precise configuration of all the smaller streets and laneways, especially one-way streets, which are common in older Toronto neighbourhoods. It's likely some small adjustments might be needed when navigating this route in person.  POIs near this route would likely include Trinity Bellwoods Park itself, residential homes, and potentially some shops and restaurants along the larger streets like Queen Street West, which is likely nearby.
