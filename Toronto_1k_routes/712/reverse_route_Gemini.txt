Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the King West/Liberty Village area, possibly near Strachan Avenue. The mention of Portland Street provides a helpful anchor.  The numerous short segments and turns indicate navigation through the potentially smaller streets and laneways of the area. I'm reasonably confident, but the lack of other street names and the many turns make it slightly less certain without visual confirmation.  Potential landmarks could include the Exhibition Place grounds, though likely not directly visible, or the various condo buildings and businesses that characterize Liberty Village.
