Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be in the The Beaches neighborhood, likely south of Queen Street East.  The relatively short segments and several turns suggest a residential area. I lack specific street names which reduces my confidence somewhat. However, the relatively simple series of turns helps in the reversal process. Potential landmarks might include the shops and restaurants along Queen Street East, residential homes, or possibly even glimpses of Lake Ontario depending on the exact location.
