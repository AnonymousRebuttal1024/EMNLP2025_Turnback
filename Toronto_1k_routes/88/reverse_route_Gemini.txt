Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route involves a series of turns that, while not using named streets except for Crawford Street, seems plausible for a residential area of Toronto.  The distances are reasonable for city blocks. The reversal is relatively straightforward.  The area is likely residential, and thus POIs would be residential properties.  My confidence is high in the reversal process itself; however the missing street names reduce overall confidence slightly.
