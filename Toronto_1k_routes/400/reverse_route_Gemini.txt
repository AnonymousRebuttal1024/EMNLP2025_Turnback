Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route, like the previous one, seems to be centered in the High Park/Roncesvalles Village neighborhoods, with street names like Neepawa, Constance, Indian Road, and Grenadier Road confirming this location. The numerous turns and short segments make this another complex residential navigation, and therefore reduce the confidence in reversing it perfectly without a map.  POIs could include High Park, the shops along Roncesvalles Avenue, or potentially Grenadier Pond.
