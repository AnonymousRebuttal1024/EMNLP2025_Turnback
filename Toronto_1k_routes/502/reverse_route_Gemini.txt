Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route likely goes through a residential area, possibly near High Park, given St. Clarens and Brandon Avenues. The numerous turns and varying distances suggest navigating local streets. "Sharp" turns and "Keep left/right" instructions make it difficult to reconstruct accurately without a visual map. I'm reasonably confident, but the complexity introduces a fair bit of uncertainty, particularly about some of the shorter, unnamed segments.
