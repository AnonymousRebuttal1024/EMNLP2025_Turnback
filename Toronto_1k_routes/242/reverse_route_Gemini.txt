Confidence: 95%

The named trails and streets (Lumsden Climb, Taylor Creek Trail, Rexleigh Gravel Climb, Ravenwood Place, Ferris Road) give me high confidence.  This route likely follows paths and roads within or near a ravine or parkland, especially considering "Gravel Climb" in the name. Taylor Creek Park is the obvious landmark in this area.  I'm very confident in the reversal due to these specific names.
