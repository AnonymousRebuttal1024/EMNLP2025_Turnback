Confidence: 92%

Reason:The route is quite complex with numerous turns and lacks easily identifiable landmarks besides street names.  The many sharp and slight turns introduce a higher potential for error during reversal compared to simpler, more linear routes. Reversing the directions is possible, but the probability of minor inaccuracies is elevated. The area is likely a residential neighbourhood with a mix of housing styles.
