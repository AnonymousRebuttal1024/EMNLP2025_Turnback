Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the eastern part of Toronto, potentially near the Beaches neighborhood.  The numerous turns and relatively short distances suggest a residential area. I'm confident in the general north-south orientation of the initial part of the route, but the sequence of right turns followed by left turns makes precise reversal somewhat tricky. The lack of street names also contributes to lower confidence. Potential landmarks could include the Lake Ontario shoreline, if it is nearby.
