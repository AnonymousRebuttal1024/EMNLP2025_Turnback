Confidence: 65%

Reasoning:  This route is likely in the west end, possibly near the Junction Triangle/Dundas West area given the mention of "St. Patrick's Market." I'm somewhat familiar with that market and the general vicinity. However, the large number of short segments and turns without clear street names makes me less confident in the precise route reconstruction.  I'm relying heavily on the accuracy of the input directions.  St. Patrick's Market itself is a significant POI, and there might be some smaller parks or community centers in the area as well, but I'm not certain without a more precise map visualization.
