Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in a residential area near Deer Park, based on streets like Heath Street East, St. Clair Avenue East, and Ferndale Avenue. The turns and distances suggest navigating through local streets, potentially close to a major road (St. Clair).  The "Keep left" instruction introduces some uncertainty. I'm reasonably confident due to the road names, but the number of unnamed turns makes precise reversal challenging.
