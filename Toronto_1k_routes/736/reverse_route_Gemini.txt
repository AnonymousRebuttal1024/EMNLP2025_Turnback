Confidence: 90%

Reasoning:  This route is simple, with only a few turns.  The long straight segment after the first turn makes it very easy to reverse. It seems to be in the North York area, potentially near Bayview Village Shopping Centre based on the coordinates, though the lack of street names makes pinpointing landmarks difficult. The simplicity of the route gives me high confidence.
