Confidence: 90%

The presence of "Broadway Avenue" and "Bessborough Drive" greatly improves my confidence.  Broadway Avenue is a significant east-west road in the Yonge and Eglinton (midtown) area. Bessborough Drive appears to be a smaller residential street intersecting with it. The initial "keep right" suggests a potential curve or a fork in the road. The shorter turns at the end suggest getting off of Broadway and navigating smaller streets. Given the coordinates and street names, I believe this route is within a residential neighborhood close to the Yonge and Eglinton intersection. This midtown area is known for its mix of residential apartments and retail shops. The Yonge and Eglinton Centre would be a significant nearby landmark, as would Eglinton subway station.
