Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be along the waterfront, using the Martin Goodman Trail, and near Cherry Beach, given the mention of the Cherry Beach Soccer Fields Trail. The Martin Goodman Trail is a paved multi-use path that runs along the Toronto waterfront.  The long distances and relatively few turns suggest a path following the shoreline. My confidence is around 80%. While the Martin Goodman Trail is straightforward, the numerous turns near the end of the route make the reversal a bit tricky without a visual aid. Also, there may be construction or closures along sections of the trail which could affect the route. Potential POIs along this route would include Cherry Beach, the Port Lands, and other waterfront parks and recreational areas.
