**Confidence: 85%**

**Reason:** This route involves many turns and specific directional shifts that need careful reversal. Named roads like Brandon Avenue and Edwin Avenue offer reliable cues to ensure accurate path reversal. The sharp turns and slightly complex intersections introduce opportunities for misinterpretation, especially if there are minor unaccounted pathways or changes in the urban environment, slightly reducing confidence. The detailed yet varied nature of these maneuvers is balanced against reliably structured directions.
