Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Greektown/Riverdale area east of the Don Valley Parkway and seems to involve navigating smaller residential streets, based on the frequent turns and relatively short segment lengths. The inclusion of Pepler Avenue provides a concrete anchor point, increasing my confidence. The "keep left" and "slight right" instructions could indicate slight curves or navigating around small obstacles.  While the lack of other street names adds some uncertainty, the presence of Pepler and the general pattern of movement provide a reasonable basis for reversing the directions. Potential POIs near this route could include Withrow Park, the shops and restaurants along the Danforth, or the residential areas surrounding Pepler Avenue.
