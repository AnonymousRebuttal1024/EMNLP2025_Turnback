This is a very simple route, likely involving a major north-south road like Kingston Road, based on the coordinates and long, straight segment. The "keep right" instruction likely represents a slight curve or a fork where the main road continues to the left. The area is in the Beaches neighborhood, and the coordinates suggest proximity to the lakefront.  The short final segment likely represents a turn onto a smaller street or driveway. The simplicity of the route makes the reversal very straightforward and highly likely to be accurate.  Queen Street East is a nearby major thoroughfare and possible landmark in this area.
