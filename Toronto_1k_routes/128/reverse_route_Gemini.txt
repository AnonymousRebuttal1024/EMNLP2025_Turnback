Confidence: 98%

Reason: The route involves a clear sequence of turns and distances, mostly along a single street (Adelaide Street West). The reversal is straightforward. My confidence is high because the instructions are precise, the distances seem realistic for city streets, and the street name Adelaide Street West is highly familiar and easily placed within the Toronto street network.  The area is likely a mix of residential and commercial buildings near Adelaide Street West.
