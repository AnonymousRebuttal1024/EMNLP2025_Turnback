This route seems to be in the Deer Park neighborhood, likely near St. Clair Avenue West. While I don't know Hillcrest Drive specifically, the street layout, with its relatively short segments and turns, fits the pattern of residential streets in that area.  The lack of longer, arterial roads in the directions suggests it's a contained route within the residential neighborhood. Deer Park is known for its quiet, affluent residential character.
