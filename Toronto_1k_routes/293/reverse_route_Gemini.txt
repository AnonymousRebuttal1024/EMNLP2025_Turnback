Confidence: 70%

Reasoning:  This route is likely in the Liberty Village or Fort York area, potentially near the Exhibition grounds. The many short segments and turns make it difficult to reconstruct precisely.  It seems to wind through smaller streets, possibly around parkland or residential buildings. The lack of street names makes confirming the route without a map difficult.  POIs in this area could include the Exhibition Place, Fort York, or the shops and restaurants in Liberty Village.
