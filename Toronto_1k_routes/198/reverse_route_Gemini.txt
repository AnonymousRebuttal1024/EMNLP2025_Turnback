Confidence: 98%

Reason: The route is relatively simple and involves turns on easily recognizable streets (Sandford and Prust Avenues) in a residential area of Toronto. Reversing the directions is straightforward, with the only possible source of error stemming from minor imprecision in the exact turning points of some of the shorter segments.  There are likely no major landmarks besides houses and the aforementioned streets.
