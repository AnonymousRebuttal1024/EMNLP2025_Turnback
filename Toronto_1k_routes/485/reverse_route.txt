Explanation: The route utilizes long stretches along Pacific Avenue, possibly navigating through Toronto’s western neighborhoods like The Junction, characterized by long and organized grid structures. The incorporated turns streamline directional simplicity, especially broken down across recognizably constant city nodal courses.
