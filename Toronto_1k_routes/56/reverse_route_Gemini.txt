Confidence: 97%

Reasoning: The reversal is largely straightforward, accurately reflecting the original route in reverse. The slight reduction in confidence comes from the several short segments and the "slight left" turn. Minor variations in the precise turning points or segment lengths could easily shift the route slightly depending on the mapping data used.  The route is in the Corso Italia area, known for its Italian restaurants and shops, near the intersection of Earlscourt Avenue and Davenport Road.
