Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the Annex neighborhood, starting near Bloor Street and moving roughly north.  Bedford Road and Elgin Avenue are good landmarks in that area. The initial long north segment suggests a major road like Bathurst or Spadina.  I'm fairly confident in the reversal, especially given the named streets. POIs might include shops and restaurants along Bloor Street near the start, and residential buildings and possibly smaller parks further north along the route.  The University of Toronto is also relatively close to this area.
