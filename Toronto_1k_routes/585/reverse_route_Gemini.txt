Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Dovercourt-Wallace Emerson-Junction area, west of Bathurst Street. The presence of Emerson Avenue helps to locate the route. The multiple turns and shorter distances suggest a residential area with a relatively complex street layout.  I'm pretty confident about the reversal, particularly with the inclusion of Emerson Avenue, though "sharp left" has been interpreted as "slight right," assuming a less sharp turn. Potential landmarks might include residential buildings, small businesses, and possibly a park given the area.
