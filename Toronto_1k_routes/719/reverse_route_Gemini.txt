Confidence: 60%

Reasoning: This route is significantly more complex with numerous turns and unnamed roads. While I recognize St. John's Road, Watson Avenue, and St. Mark's Road as being in the west end near Runnymede, the many turns without street names decrease my confidence.  I'm relying on a general sense of the street grid in that area rather than specific knowledge of the smaller streets.  Potential landmarks might include Runnymede Public School and the surrounding residential areas. I have a lower confidence due to the complexity of the route and lack of named streets for most of the navigation.
