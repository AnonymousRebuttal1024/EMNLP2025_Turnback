Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be in the York University Heights neighbourhood, near York University.  Sir William Hearst Avenue provides a solid anchor point, and the very long segment (1279.5m) suggests a major road like Keele Street.  I'm quite confident in the reversal, particularly the beginning and end sections because of the named street. York University campus is a major landmark in the area.
