Confidence: 95%

This route appears to be downtown, using the PATH system.  The "PATH" designation indicates an underground pedestrian walkway. The long stretches within the PATH increase my confidence as the turns are likely within well-defined underground corridors. Given the start and end points are close to each other and the route largely follows the PATH, the reversed directions are likely very accurate. Potential landmarks above ground might include the Eaton Centre, Dundas Square, or office towers depending on the exact PATH section used.
