Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: My confidence is 95% because the route, while having several turns, includes a prominent street name, Davies Avenue, and  Power Street. The sequence of turns is relatively straightforward to reverse, and the distances are reasonable. The presence of named streets significantly reduces the ambiguity compared to routes relying on compass directions alone in unfamiliar areas.  The relatively longer segments towards the end also improve the accuracy of the reverse directions.  The only slight uncertainty would come from interpreting 'keep right' or 'keep left' instructions along longer segments, but this uncertainty is minor.
