Explanation: This route appears to be in the Don Mills area, likely near the Science Centre and the Ontario Science Centre subway station, based on the coordinates and the mention of Wynford Drive. I am reasonably familiar with the main roads in that area. The "keep left" and "slight right" instructions introduce some ambiguity, but the overall route seems relatively simple, with longer, straighter segments.  POIs would include the Ontario Science Centre, the Aga Khan Museum, and potentially some office buildings.
