Confidence: 98%

Reason: The route is short and simple, with a clear starting point on Rolph Road. The reversal is very straightforward. My high confidence is due to the simplicity of the route and the clear directional instructions. The only potential source of error is the precise measurement of short distances, but these are unlikely to cause significant misdirection.  Iâ€™d guess this is a residential or relatively quiet street in Toronto.
