Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is relatively straightforward, with Chatsworth Drive as a helpful landmark. This area is likely in the York University Heights or near Clanton Park based on the street name and relative simplicity of the route which implies a residential area. The long 452.0-meter and 365.5-meter segments likely follow major streets in the area. The initial north and final south directions align with the changes in the coordinates. The "keep left" introduces minor ambiguity, but the overall simplicity increases confidence in the reversed route.
