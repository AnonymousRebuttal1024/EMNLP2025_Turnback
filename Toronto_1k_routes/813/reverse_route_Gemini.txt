This route appears to be east of the downtown core, starting near Parliament and going toward the Don Valley Parkway and Riverdale, based on the coordinates and the mention of Sackville Street.  The two long "keep right/left" segments likely represent following major roads, possibly Eastern Avenue and then north along the Don Valley Parkway or a parallel road like Bayview Avenue. Sackville Street serves as a good endpoint landmark. The relatively few turns increase confidence in the reversal.  Riverdale Park could be a nearby POI.
