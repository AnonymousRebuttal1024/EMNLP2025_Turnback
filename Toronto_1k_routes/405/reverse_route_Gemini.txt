Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route appears to primarily follow Logan Avenue, a significant street in the Leslieville/South Riverdale area. The starting point is likely near the intersection of Carlaw and Queen. The long stretch along Logan provides a strong anchor, and the relatively few turns increase confidence.  However, the initial short turns and lack of other prominent landmarks introduce some uncertainty. POIs could include businesses along Queen Street East, or perhaps Jimmie Simpson Park if it's close.
