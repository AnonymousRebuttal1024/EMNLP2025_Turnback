Explanation: The path seems to navigate through a central-west part of Toronto, starting from a location near the vibrant Yonge Street corridor and heading towards areas like Bloorcourt Village or the western part of the Annex. The sequence of directions primarily follows straightforward arterial roads with few diversions, which suggests common urban routing that's easy to reverse through known paths. This simplicity lends a high confidence level in the reverse navigation, assuming well-maintained major roads consistent with the Toronto street grid.
