This route appears to be in the Don Valley Parkway and York Mills area. Pavane Linkway is a small road near the DVP, which lends some credence to this location.  The long segments suggest following major roads like the DVP or York Mills Road itself. However, the lack of other specific street names and the presence of shorter segments make the precise route unclear. The "Keep Left" instruction hints at highway on/off ramps or navigating complex intersections.  This area is mixed residential and commercial, bordering on parkland along the Don Valley.
