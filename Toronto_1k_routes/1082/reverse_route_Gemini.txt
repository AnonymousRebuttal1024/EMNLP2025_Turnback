Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: The coordinates indicate a location near O'Connor Drive and Bermondsey Road, heading roughly northeast. The long, relatively straight sections suggest major roads like O'Connor or Eglinton, interspersed with shorter segments likely on residential streets. The absence of street names makes precise reversal challenging, particularly for the shorter segments.  While I'm moderately confident about the overall westward and then southward direction for the initial part of the reverse, the exact angles of turns introduce some uncertainty. POIs in the area might include the shops and restaurants along Eglinton Avenue East, or potentially Taylor Creek Park if the route goes far enough south.
