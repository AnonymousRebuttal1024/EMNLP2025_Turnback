Reason: The route involves a number of turns and street names, making the reversal moderately complex but still manageable. The street names (Linsmore Crescent, Leroy Avenue, Frankdale Avenue, Sammon Avenue, Inwood Avenue) are recognizable within the Toronto street network, enhancing confidence in the accuracy of the reversal. The only minor source of uncertainty is in the precise location of some of the smaller turns and the shorter distances, but the overall sequence and direction are clear. The area is likely residential.
