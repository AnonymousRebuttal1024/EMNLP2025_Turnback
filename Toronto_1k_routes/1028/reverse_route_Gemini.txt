Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the King West/Liberty Village area, just west of downtown Toronto, based on the coordinates.  The mix of shorter and longer segments suggests navigating smaller streets and potentially a section of a larger road like King Street West or Strachan Avenue.  The "keep left/right" instructions could indicate slight curves, and the lack of specific street names makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact route with high certainty. I am reasonably confident about the initial southward direction and the general sequence of turns, but the precise distances and angles might be slightly off due to the lack of landmarks. Potential POIs near this area could include the Exhibition Place, Liberty Village shops and restaurants, or the parks along the waterfront.
