Confidence: 70%

Reasoning:  This route seems to be in the Dovercourt-Wallace Emerson-Junction area, possibly close to Bloor Street West.  The lack of street names makes the precise path harder to determine. The long, somewhat meandering segment suggests a walk along a less direct route, potentially through residential streets.  I'm moderately confident in the general southward direction to reverse the starting westward movement and the final eastward segment. However, the exact placement of the smaller turns is uncertain. POIs in the vicinity might include the shops and restaurants along Bloor St West, or possibly Christie Pits Park, depending on the precise location.
