Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route seems to start near Allan Gardens and heads generally west. Carlton Street and Exchange Lane are excellent landmarks, placing the start of the route very close to the College subway station. The two longer segments (412.5m and 426.7m) likely represent significant portions of Carlton and a parallel street, possibly Gerrard Street East. I'm very confident in the reversed directions due to these prominent street names and the relatively straightforward nature of the turns. POIs in this area include Allan Gardens, the College Park shopping mall, and numerous businesses along Yonge Street, which is likely just a block or two east of this route.
