Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route appears to start near the intersection of Jane Street and Bloor Street West, and heads generally northwest. The long 772.1m leg suggests a major road, likely Jane Street.  The shorter segments suggest navigating smaller residential streets in the area.  I'm reasonably confident because of the long straight segment providing an anchor, but the lack of many named streets makes it a little harder to be entirely certain. Potential POIs near the starting point might include businesses along Bloor Street West or the Jane subway station.  The destination appears to be in a residential area.
