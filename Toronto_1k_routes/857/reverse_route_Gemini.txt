Reasoning: Southill Drive provides a good landmark. The route is simple with only a few turns, making reversal easy and reliable.  The area appears to be residential based on the street name.  Potential POIs could include homes along Southill Drive and possibly a nearby park or school, but it's difficult to say for certain without cross-street information. Given the coordinates, this is likely in the northeast part of Toronto, potentially near Don Mills or Victoria Park, based on my general knowledge of the city.
