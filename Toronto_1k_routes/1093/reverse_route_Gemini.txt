Reasoning: Humber Bay Park Road West is a key identifier, placing the route near the Humber Bay Shores waterfront area. This road runs along the eastern edge of Humber Bay Park East. The other turns are likely within the residential streets of the neighborhood.  While some uncertainty exists regarding the precise angles of turns in the residential sections, the inclusion of Humber Bay Park Road West makes the overall reversal reasonably reliable.  Potential POIs would include Humber Bay Park East, the waterfront trails, and possibly the Mimico Cruising Club.
