Explanation: The route was reversed by using notable street names, specifically Windermere Avenue, indicative of the western segment of Toronto in or around the Swansea neighborhood or near the Humber River trails. The sequence of instructions was meticulously reversed to follow a logical and accurate navigation path, given the arrangement within the general grid layoutâ€”although some minor uncertainty exists due to the specific adjustments between rights and sharp/regular lefts, the methodical approach afforded significant confidence in accurately achieving the retraced path.
