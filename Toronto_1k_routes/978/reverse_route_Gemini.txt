Confidence: 75%

This route appears to be near Roncesvalles Avenue, likely just north of High Park. I recognize Boston Avenue as a residential street in the area. The very long 1015.5-meter segment likely follows a major east-west artery like Dundas Street West or Bloor Street West. The other segments are short, suggesting turns onto smaller residential streets. This area has a mix of residential and commercial properties, with High Park a significant landmark nearby. My confidence is slightly reduced due to the lack of other named streets and the potential for slight deviations from the road network due to pedestrian shortcuts.
