Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Junction Triangle, just north of Dupont Street. The key landmark here is the West Toronto Railpath, a converted railway line now used as a pedestrian and cycling trail. Elsie Lane is a small street nearby.  The presence of the railpath and Elsie Lane significantly boosts my confidence.  The other short segments likely represent connections to and from the railpath via local streets.
