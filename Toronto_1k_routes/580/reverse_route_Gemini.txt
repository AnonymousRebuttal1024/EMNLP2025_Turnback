Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Don Valley area, likely within or near the Milne Valley neighborhood, possibly involving the Don Valley Parkway and some residential streets alongside the valley.  The presence of Green Belt Drive and The Heights Drive provides strong clues.  I'm relatively confident in the reversal, particularly with those street names.  The Don Valley ravine system and associated parkland would be significant landmarks in the area.
