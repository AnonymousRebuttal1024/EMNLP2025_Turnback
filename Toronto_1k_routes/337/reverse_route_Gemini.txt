Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route seems to be located near the Yonge and Eglinton area.  The coordinates suggest a generally north-south trajectory. The lack of named streets makes it harder to pinpoint precisely. I'm assuming a fairly regular grid pattern, which is typical of that area. The presence of some longer, straight segments increases my confidence in the general direction.  However, without street names, it's difficult to be certain about the specific turns. Potential POIs in the broader vicinity could include businesses along Yonge Street, residential buildings, and perhaps parks like Eglinton Park or Alexander Muir Memorial Gardens.
