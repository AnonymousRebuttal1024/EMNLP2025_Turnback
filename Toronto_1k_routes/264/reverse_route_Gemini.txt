Head West, continue for 9.7 meters.
Turn left onto [assumed connecting street to long east segment], continue for 849.6 meters.
Arrive at your destination, straight ahead, continue for 0.0 meters.


Confidence: 90%

The long, straight 849.6-meter segment suggests a major road, likely Sheppard Ave West. This makes reversing the direction straightforward.  Jedburgh Road intersecting it provides a good landmark. The coordinates place this in the north-central part of the city near Sheppard West subway station, so I'm confident in the general area. Likely landmarks would include residential buildings and some commercial properties along Sheppard Ave W.  I'm assuming the initial "east" segment connects directly back with a left turn; without a street name for that segment, there is a slight possibility of an unnamed smaller street or lane involved which would lower confidence slightly.
