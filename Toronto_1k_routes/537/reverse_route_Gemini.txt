Confidence: 75%

This route appears to be in the Junction area, possibly near Dundas Street West and Keele Street, based on street names like Paton Road, Ritchie Avenue, and the presence of small mews and crescents like Rankin Crescent and Dekoven Mews. These features suggest a mix of residential and light industrial/commercial uses.  I have moderate confidence (75%) in the reversed directions. The numerous turns, short segments, and smaller streets make it tricky to be entirely sure without a map. Small adjustments might be necessary in reality. Potential POIs might include small businesses, residential homes, and potentially the nearby Dundas West shops and restaurants.
