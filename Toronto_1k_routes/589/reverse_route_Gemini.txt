Confidence: 70%

This route seems to be in the Regent Park area, east of the downtown core. The high number of turns and relatively short segments suggest navigating smaller streets and possibly some pathways within the neighborhood.  The absence of street names makes pinpointing the location and identifying landmarks more difficult.  I'm somewhat confident about the reversed directions, but the "sharp right" and "slight right" are interpretations, translated to "slight left" assuming gentler turns in the reverse. Regent Park is a revitalized neighborhood with a mix of residential buildings, community facilities, and green spaces.
