Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: My confidence is 85% because while the reversal of turns is straightforward, the numerous short segments and the inclusion of "Corktown Common Trail" (which I assume is a linear path) make precise reversal slightly challenging without access to a map showing its exact dimensions and layout.  The numerous minor turns and short distances still introduce uncertainty.  The lack of context about surrounding streets also reduces confidence.  If more details about nearby buildings or intersections were provided, my confidence level could increase.
