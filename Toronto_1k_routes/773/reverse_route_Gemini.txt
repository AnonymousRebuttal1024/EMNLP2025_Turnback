This route involves primarily south and then east movement, based on the coordinates, likely near the Don Valley Parkway and the area east of the downtown core.  The long 1003.1-meter segment suggests following a major road, possibly the Don Valley Parkway itself or a parallel road. The short 8.3-meter segment at the end likely indicates a turn onto a smaller street or driveway. The "keep right" instruction might be a curve on the parkway or a slight bend in the road. Reversing this route is straightforward due to the limited number of turns. POIs along a route like this might include Riverdale Park East, or if it is near the Don Valley Parkway, then the trail system along the Don River.
