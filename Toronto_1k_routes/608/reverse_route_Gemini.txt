Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Thistletown neighborhood of Etobicoke, near the Humber River. Donofree Road helps to anchor the route's location.  The long straight segment after the initial turns suggests a main road such as Islington Avenue or Albion Road. I'm fairly confident about the reversal, particularly due to the presence of Donofree Road. Potential landmarks might include residential buildings, some commercial establishments along the major roads, and possibly parkland near the Humber River.
