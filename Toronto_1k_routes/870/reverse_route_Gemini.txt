Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the East York area near Woodbine and Danforth Avenues based on the coordinates and street names (Gower, Meighen). I'm reasonably familiar with the main streets in this area. Gower Street and Meighen Avenue likely represent residential streets. Potential POIs might include schools, parks, and local businesses along Danforth Ave, which is likely nearby. The presence of these residential street names increases my confidence. The route is relatively straightforward, which adds to the confidence level.
