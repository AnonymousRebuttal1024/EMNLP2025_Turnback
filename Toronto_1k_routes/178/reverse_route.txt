**Reason:** This navigation has multiple turns and switching pathways that can add complexity, yet it uses clear streets such as Memorial Park Avenue and Dieppe Road to facilitate directional alignment in structured form. While urban path complexities are acknowledged through turn management, structured maneuvers effectively position path reversals as a balanced directive in producing a navigationally corrected sequence.
