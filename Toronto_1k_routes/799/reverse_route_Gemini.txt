Confidence: 80%

This route is likely in the west end, possibly near the Dovercourt-Wallace Emerson-Junction area, given the coordinates and mention of Geary Avenue, Ossington Avenue, Acores Avenue, and Shaw Street. These streets provide good landmarks, although Ossington and Shaw are quite long streets so this does not pinpoint the location precisely. The numerous "sharp" turns suggest navigating smaller streets and intersections. The "keep left" likely represents a slight curve or bend. While the street names increase confidence, the short segments and sharp turns make the precise path harder to reverse perfectly.  Likely POIs would include businesses along Ossington or Dundas West.
