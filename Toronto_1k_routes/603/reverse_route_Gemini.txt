Confidence: 85%

This route appears to originate in the Kensington Market area and head generally north towards College Street. Augusta Avenue and Cecil Street provide solid anchor points. The numerous short segments and turns strongly suggest navigating the smaller streets and laneways characteristic of Kensington Market. I'm fairly confident in the reversed directions, especially with the named streets.  There might be a slight adjustment needed for some turns with "slight left/right". Potential landmarks in this area include the diverse shops and restaurants of Kensington Market, as well as some of the art galleries and music venues that are found closer to College Street.
