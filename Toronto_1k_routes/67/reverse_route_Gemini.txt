Confidence: 95%

Reason:  The route is relatively straightforward and involves mostly turning in the opposite direction.  The street names are specific and easily identifiable in this area of Toronto. The only slight uncertainty is precise placement of the initial Parkade Entrance - the reversing instructions assume it's directly opposite the final location on Clock Tower Road.  The overall route logic, however, is very high confidence.  The area is near the intersection of Clock Tower Road and Karl Fraser Road, close to some residential buildings and likely some smaller businesses.
