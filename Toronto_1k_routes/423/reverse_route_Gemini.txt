Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the Mimico neighborhood near the lakefront, possibly close to Humber Bay Park East. Marine Parade Drive and Manitoba Street are consistent with that area.  The turns suggest a mix of residential and potentially park-adjacent navigation. The relatively few long stretches introduce some uncertainty, but the presence of named streets adds confidence. Potential POIs could be Humber Bay Park East or the Mimico waterfront park.
