Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route seems to be just west of Bathurst Street and south of Bloor Street West.  The lack of street names makes precise navigation difficult, but the coordinates and turns suggest movement through a residential area. I'm reasonably confident about the general direction and the longer segments, but the shorter turns and "keep" instructions introduce some ambiguity. Potential POIs could include residential homes and possibly small businesses along Bathurst.
