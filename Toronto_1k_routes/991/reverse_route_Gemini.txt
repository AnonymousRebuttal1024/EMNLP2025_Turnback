This route is likely in the Warden and Lawrence East area of Scarborough. Holswade Road is a residential street there.

The lack of other street names makes pinpointing the exact location and confirming the reverse directions a bit more challenging. The shorter segments likely represent residential street connections and potentially pedestrian pathways.
