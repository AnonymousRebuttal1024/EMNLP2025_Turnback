Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is in the Riverdale neighbourhood of Toronto, east of the Don Valley Parkway. The presence of Eastview Path, Myrtle Avenue, Bushell Avenue, Leslie Street, Hastings Avenue, and Stanton Avenue gives me very high confidence. These streets are all accurately located and their sequence makes geographic sense within the neighborhood. The numerous turns and relatively short segment lengths suggest navigating through residential streets, potentially with some small parks or green spaces interspersed. POIs could include Withrow Park, Riverdale Park East, or the shops and restaurants along Danforth Avenue.
