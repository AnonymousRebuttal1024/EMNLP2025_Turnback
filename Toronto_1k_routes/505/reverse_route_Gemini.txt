Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route seems to navigate a residential area, possibly east of the Don Valley. Ozark Crescent, Cambridge Avenue, Browning Avenue, Canning Avenue, Pape Avenue and Selkirk Street are useful landmarks.  The many short segments and turns, however, make precise reversal difficult.  "Keep left" introduces some ambiguity. This area is likely in Greektown or east of it based on these street names.  I'm moderately confident because of the street names, but the many unnamed turns and short segments lower the certainty.
