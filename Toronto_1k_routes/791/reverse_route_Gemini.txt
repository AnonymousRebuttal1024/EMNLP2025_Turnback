Confidence: 80%

This route is near the Junction Triangle/Wallace Emerson area, given the coordinates and the mention of Wanda Road and the West Toronto Railpath, which is a prominent landmark.  The presence of the railpath significantly increases my confidence. The numerous short segments and turns, as well as the "slight" and "sharp" turn qualifiers, suggest a route that weaves through residential streets and possibly laneways, making it a bit more challenging to reverse with absolute certainty.  POIs might include the West Toronto Railpath itself, or businesses along Dupont Street.
