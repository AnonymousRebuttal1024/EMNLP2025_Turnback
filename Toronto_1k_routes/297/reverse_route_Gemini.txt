Confidence: 75%

Reasoning:  This route appears to be in the Cedarvale neighbourhood, near the intersection of Bathurst Street and Eglinton Avenue West.  Street names like Doncaster, Chisholm, Epsom, Cedarvale, and Sammon are all located in this area. The numerous turns and relatively short distances suggest a winding path through residential streets. Without a map, it's difficult to be certain of the precise turns, especially the "sharp right" and "slight left" instructions. Potential POIs near this route might include Cedarvale Park and the Eglinton West subway station.
