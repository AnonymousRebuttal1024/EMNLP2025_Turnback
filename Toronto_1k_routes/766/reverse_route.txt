Confidence: 85%

Explanation: The instruction reversal was completed by reflecting spatial maneuvering that aligns with Toronto's road constructs nearby Bloor-Yorkville, an area encountering a mix of residential streets and major thoroughfares. The diverse composition of turns adds some complexity, but awareness of urban patterns helps ensure reliable execution of the steps backward. Uncertainty is minimally present due to this methodical approach, hence moderately high confidence.
