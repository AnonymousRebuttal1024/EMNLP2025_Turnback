Confidence: 95%

The street names Argyle Street, Gladstone Avenue, Peel Avenue, and Dufferin Street provide very strong location information. This route is in the Little Portugal neighborhood, a predominantly residential area known for its Portuguese heritage and businesses along Dundas Street West. Argyle Street is a significant east-west street, while Dufferin Street is a major north-south arterial road.  The relatively short segments and turns suggest a standard grid pattern. I have high confidence in the accuracy of the reversal because of the specific street names. Trinity Bellwoods Park is a significant landmark nearby.
