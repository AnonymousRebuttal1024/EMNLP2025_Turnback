Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route is in the Forest Hill South/Casa Loma area, characterized by winding streets and ravines. Allen Pathway, Tommy Douglas Gardens, West Belt Line Trail, Hopewell Avenue, Whitmore Avenue and Kirknewton Road are excellent landmarks.  The many turns and named paths/streets increase my confidence.  However, some short, unnamed segments might be slightly off due to the complexity of the area's paths and potential for smaller access ways. Potential POIs include the Beltline Trail itself, residential homes in this affluent neighbourhood, and possibly Casa Loma itself if the route is close to its grounds.
