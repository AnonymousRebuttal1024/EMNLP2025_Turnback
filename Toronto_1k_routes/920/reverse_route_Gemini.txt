Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is in a residential area, likely near York Mills and Bayview Avenue, judging by the coordinates. Samor Road exists in that area. The route is relatively simple with only a few turns, making the reversal fairly straightforward. I'm confident about the general direction and the presence of Samor Road, which anchors the route. Potential landmarks could include residential buildings, a small parkette, or possibly a local school.
