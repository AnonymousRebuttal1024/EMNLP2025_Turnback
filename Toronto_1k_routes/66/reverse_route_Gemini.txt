Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route likely involves navigating a somewhat complex road network, possibly near the Don Valley Parkway or a similar area given the numerous turns and varying distances. The repeated "keep right/left" suggests highway-like sections.  While the reversal of turns is straightforward, the lack of street names makes precise GIS correlation and POI identification difficult, hence the slight reduction in confidence.  I'm assuming standard road layouts and trying to maintain a consistent path based on the turns provided.  It's possible the route involves some smaller side streets or service roads, impacting the accuracy of a simple reversal.
