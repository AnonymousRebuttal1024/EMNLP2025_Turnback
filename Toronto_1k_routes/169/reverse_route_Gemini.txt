Confidence: 92%

Reason: The route is relatively straightforward with the inclusion of Gore Street and Clinton Street which helps with geographic placement (likely a central or slightly less residential area of Toronto). Reversing is easy except for a couple of short segments and slight turns that could have different interpretations. The potential for slight error exists due to the short distances and the slight turns.  The streets provided are likely to be within a reasonably dense urban area.
