Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the High Park North neighbourhood, potentially near the intersection of Glenlake Avenue and Durie Street.  The numerous turns suggest a residential area with smaller blocks.  I'm quite confident in the initial and final legs, as Glenlake Avenue provides a clear anchor. The mid-route section with shorter segments and turns is less certain, as I lack precise street names to verify those maneuvers.  There could be small alleys or pedestrian walkways involved that I'm not accounting for.  High Park itself is a major landmark potentially visible depending on the exact location along the route.
