Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route is a relatively straightforward sequence of turns through what seems like a residential area of Toronto, but it involves a number of smaller streets. The reversal is easy to follow, and the distances are reasonable for city blocks. The street names (Wallace Avenue, Macaulay Avenue, Perth Avenue, Adrian Avenue) sound plausible for Toronto, but I'm not completely familiar with the precise layout of this particular area.  The high number of turns does however provide some minor uncertainty in the relative position of the smaller streets.  POIs in this area are likely to be residential properties.
