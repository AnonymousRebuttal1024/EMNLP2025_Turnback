Confidence: 80%

Reasoning:  This route appears to be in the Yonge and Eglinton area, likely near the intersection of Sighthill Avenue and Inglewood Drive. The turns and distances suggest navigation through residential streets, possibly with some curves. The presence of named streets increases confidence, but the lack of major intersections or landmarks makes it somewhat difficult to be certain about the accuracy of the reverse directions without a map. POIs might include the shops and restaurants around Yonge and Eglinton, or a nearby park like Blythwood Ravine Park.
