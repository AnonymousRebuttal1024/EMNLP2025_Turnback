Confidence: 85%

Reason: This route is fairly straightforward, but the lack of street names after the initial instruction makes it slightly less certain.  The reliance on "continue straight," "slight left," and "slight right" introduces some ambiguity. While I can confidently reverse the directions given, the precision of the distances and the exact nature of the slight turns are less certain without more context. There are no recognizable landmarks mentioned.  I'm assuming "Andy Olvet Lane" is a minor street and that the longer distances involve travel on other streets, potentially residential ones in a part of Toronto I'm not familiar with, lowering confidence.
