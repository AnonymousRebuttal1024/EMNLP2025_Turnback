Reason:The route involves a series of turns and directions, making the reversal slightly more complex. While the distances are specified, the lack of street names makes it harder to be absolutely certain of the precise route and the minor turns (slight left/right, sharp left) could be interpreted slightly differently when reversing. The area is likely residential with few notable landmarks.
