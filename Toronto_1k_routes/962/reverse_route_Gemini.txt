Confidence: 60%

This route appears to be in the High Park North neighborhood. Frankdale Avenue is a key road in that area, and Chan Lane exists as a small side street.  However, the high number of turns and very short segments (e.g., 6.5 meters, 7.2 meters, 9.8 meters) significantly decreases my confidence. It's highly probable that this route represents a walking path with multiple turns within a smaller area, possibly including walkways or lanes that don't perfectly align with the road network. This area has a mix of residential housing and some parkland, so that further contributes to the potential complexity of the pedestrian route vs. the road network.
