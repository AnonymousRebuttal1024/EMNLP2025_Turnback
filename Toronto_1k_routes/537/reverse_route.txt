Explanation: The route is composed of predominantly linear, clearly defined streets, like Rankin Crescent, Paton Road, and Dekoven Mews, which minimize confusion in retracing steps backward. The organization within this segment of Toronto facilitates path repetition, supported by straightforward urban terrain. As these segments intrinsically connect surrounding residential areas in a cohesive grid, otherwise prominent lanes are apt to support accurate directional conveyance within their straightforward layout.
