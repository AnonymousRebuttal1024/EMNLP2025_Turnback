Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Baby Point neighborhood in the west end of Toronto. The presence of Baby Point Road and Brumell Avenue significantly increases my confidence as these are distinct streets in that area.  The route mainly involves navigating residential streets, and the turns are generally clear, although the multiple "keep right" instructions introduce slight uncertainty about which forks were taken. Landmarks in the vicinity might include residential homes, Humber River, or Etienne Brule Park.
