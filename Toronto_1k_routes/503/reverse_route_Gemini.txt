Confidence: 75%

Reasoning:  This route goes through a primarily residential area, likely in the west end.  Manning Avenue is a good landmark and suggests the route might be near Trinity Bellwoods or just west of it. The combination of short segments and "slight" turns, along with "keep left", adds uncertainty, as these could represent subtle curves or minor roads not easily discernible without a map. I'm reasonably confident, but the lack of other named streets and the potentially ambiguous turns reduce the certainty.
