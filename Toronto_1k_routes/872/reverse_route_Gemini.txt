Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the south-west of Etobicoke, near Park Lawn Road and The Queensway, based on the coordinates and street name. I'm somewhat familiar with the general area, but this route involves many turns on smaller streets which reduces my confidence.  The area is primarily residential with some commercial areas along The Queensway.  Possible POIs include  parks and residential buildings.
