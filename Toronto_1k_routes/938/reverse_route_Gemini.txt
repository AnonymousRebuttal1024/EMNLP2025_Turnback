Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Coxwell and Gerrard area, east of the Don Valley Parkway. The inclusion of Glebemount, Westlake Crescent, and Hamstead Avenue helps pinpoint the location, which is largely residential. The multiple "keep left/right" instructions and the "slight left" turns make precise reconstruction challenging. I'm less certain about the accuracy of the smaller turns and possible laneways or driveways involved. Possible landmarks include residential homes, the Taylor Creek ravine system, or perhaps a local school or park.
