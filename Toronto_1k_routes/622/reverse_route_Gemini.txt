Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route seems to start in the Parkdale neighborhood (near Dufferin Grove Park) and heads generally northeast.  The long 1005.6-meter stretch suggests a major arterial road, possibly Queen Street West or Dundas Street West. The remaining instructions likely navigate smaller residential streets.  I'm reasonably confident because of the long straight section which anchors the route, but the lack of named streets (other than Harrison and the destination Leonard) makes it somewhat difficult to be completely certain. Possible POIs near the start could be Dufferin Grove Park or businesses along Dufferin Street. Closer to the destination, there might be residential buildings and possibly smaller shops along Queen or Dundas, depending on the precise location of Leonard Avenue.
