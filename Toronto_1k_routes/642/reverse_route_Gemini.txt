Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route seems to be within the Riverdale neighbourhood, east of the Don Valley Parkway. Dewhurst Blvd North, Sammon Avenue, Woodycrest Avenue, and Gertrude Place are good local street names that help pinpoint the area.  It appears to move generally south and east. I'm fairly confident due to these named streets, but a couple of unnamed short turns introduce a small level of uncertainty. POIs might include residential buildings, Withrow Park if the route happens to go near it, or potentially a few businesses along Pape Avenue, which is likely a few blocks to the west.
