Confidence: 75%

This route seems to be in the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood, based on the presence of Manor Road East and Erskine Avenue.  "Lane East Mount Pleasant South Manor" is likely a small lane or side street off of Mount Pleasant Road. The numerous short segments and frequent turns suggest a complex route navigating the residential streets. I'm moderately confident, particularly in the section containing the named roads. The other parts with shorter, unnamed segments are harder to reconstruct accurately without a visual reference.  Potential landmarks could include the shops and restaurants along Mount Pleasant Road or the residential buildings characteristic of the area.
