Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be in the Beach neighborhood, likely close to Woodbine Park. The presence of Southwood Drive, Williamson Road, Balsam Avenue, Hazel Avenue, and Fernwood Park Avenue anchors the route very well.  I'm highly confident in the reversed directions because of these street names.  Woodbine Park and the beaches along Lake Ontario would be prominent landmarks, along with the residential buildings in the area. The many short turns likely reflects the local street network.
