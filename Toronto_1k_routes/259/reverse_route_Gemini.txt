Confidence: 95%

The street names David Dunlap Circle and Humphrey Gate are very specific, making me quite confident in the reversal, especially combined with the detailed turn instructions. This is near the David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill, which is the most prominent landmark.  The area is likely a mix of residential properties and open spaces related to the observatory.
