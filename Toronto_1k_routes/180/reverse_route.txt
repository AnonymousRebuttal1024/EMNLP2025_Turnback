**Reason:** This path comprises several sharp and slight turns, and attention to slight directional changes ensures a clear reversal. Segments such as those requiring right and left angles provide structured sequences, presenting effective linear guidance across the urban network for optimal turn-to-turn navigation. Given variability potential in sharper and slight curvatures, directional leverage positions strategic recalibration for suitable directional return enactment, thus granting robust navigation fidelity outcomes.
