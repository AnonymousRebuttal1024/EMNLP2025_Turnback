Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: Alcorn Avenue provides a good starting point. The lane also is named, offering a clear landmark for the initial turn.  The relatively few instructions suggest a fairly simple route. "Sharp right" provides a clear directional change. Potential POIs might include residential buildings or some small businesses along Alcorn and the surrounding streets. The area is likely in midtown Toronto, potentially near Yonge and Davisville based on the "Yonge" in the lane name and my general knowledge of Toronto's street layout. This knowledge of the area helps increase confidence.
