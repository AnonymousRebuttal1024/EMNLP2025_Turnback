Confidence: 88%

Reasoning: My confidence is 88% because this route involves a significant number of turns and several street names (Franklin Avenue, Parkman Avenue, Perth Avenue, Antler Street, Wallace Avenue, St. Clarens Avenue).  The presence of these landmarks helps in the reversal.  However, the many short segments and numerous turns introduce some uncertainty, especially regarding the precise placement of the shorter segments.  The overall path is reasonably clear to reverse but minor discrepancies in distance and turn angles are possible in my mental reconstruction of the route without access to a real map.
