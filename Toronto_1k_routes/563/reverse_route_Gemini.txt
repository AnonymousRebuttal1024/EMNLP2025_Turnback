Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be in the Rosedale area, possibly near Yonge Street and Crescent Road, based on street names like Cluny Drive, Rowanwood Avenue, and Tamblyn Lane, which are in that vicinity. Chestnut Park is a smaller road nearby as well.  The long segment of 1029.3 meters likely follows a major road like Yonge Street or Mount Pleasant Road. The many shorter segments and turns suggest navigation through a residential neighborhood with curving streets. My confidence is around 85%.  The street names give me a good anchor, but without a map, it is difficult to confirm if all those minor streets connect up precisely or if they are one way, etc. Possible POIs near this route include Rosedale Park, residential homes, and businesses along the major north-south streets.
