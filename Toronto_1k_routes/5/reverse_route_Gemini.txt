Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the west end, potentially near the Junction Triangle given the proximity to the previous route and the mention of "Ditty Lane". I'm somewhat familiar with the area's general layout, but the numerous unnamed segments make precise reversal tricky.  I'm assuming the turns given in the input are accurate.  Without street names and more context, it's difficult to identify specific POIs, though it's likely a residential area with perhaps some small businesses or parks nearby.
