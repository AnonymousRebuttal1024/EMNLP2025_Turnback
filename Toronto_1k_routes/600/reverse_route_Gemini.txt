Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the Junction Triangle, west of Lansdowne Avenue. The long straight section suggests a major road, likely Dupont Street. The lack of street names makes pinpointing the precise location difficult. I'm moderately confident in the reversed directions, but the "sharp right" and "slight right" interpretations (translated to "sharp left" and "slight left" in reverse) introduce some uncertainty.  Potential landmarks could include the shops and restaurants along Dupont Street, as well as some of the industrial buildings that characterize the Junction Triangle.
