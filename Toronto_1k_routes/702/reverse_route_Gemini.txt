Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Leaside neighbourhood, starting near Wicksteed Avenue and ending near Hanna Road.  The inclusion of Clarke Street, Randolph Road, Parkhurst Boulevard, and Hanna Road helps pinpoint the area.  The route likely involves navigating residential streets. I'm fairly confident in the reversal, thanks to the provided street names, especially towards the end of the route. The initial segments have a few more unnamed turns, which are slightly less certain. Potential landmarks might include the Leaside Memorial Gardens or the shops and restaurants along Bayview Avenue.
