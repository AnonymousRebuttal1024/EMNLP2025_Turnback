Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route likely starts near the intersection of University Avenue and Queen Street West, heading south towards the Entertainment District.  Queen Street West is a major east-west artery, and the PATH is a network of underground pedestrian walkways, indicating a destination likely within a building connected to the PATH. The numerous short turns and segments suggest navigating smaller streets and potentially through building complexes, which increases uncertainty without a visual aid. Potential POIs might include the Princess of Wales Theatre, the Royal Alexandra Theatre, and various office buildings.
