Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route likely follows a major east-west artery, given the long, straight initial segment of 1376.8 meters. Based on the coordinates, this is probably somewhere just north of the Bloor Street West area, possibly a section of Bloor itself or a parallel street like Dundas Street West.  The short northbound segment at the end likely represents a turn onto a smaller side street.  The simplicity of the route increases my confidence in reversing it. While I don't have specific street names, the general direction and the length of the initial leg provide strong clues.  Possible POIs near this route could include High Park, the shops and restaurants along Bloor West, or the residential areas north of Bloor.
