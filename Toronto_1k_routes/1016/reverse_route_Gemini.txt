Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Upper Beaches neighbourhood, east of the Don Valley, potentially near Woodbine and Danforth Avenues, based on the coordinates and the presence of Teesdale Place.  The numerous turns and relatively short segments are characteristic of residential streets in that area. The longer "continue straight" segments could indicate stretches along Woodbine or a similar arterial road. My knowledge of the general street layout in the Upper Beaches, combined with the specific mention of Teesdale Place, gives me good confidence. I am slightly less than 100% confident due to the lack of other street names and the "keep left/right" instructions which could involve small, unmarked streets or alleys. Potential POIs near this area could include shops and restaurants along Danforth Avenue, the beaches along Lake Ontario, or Woodbine Park.
