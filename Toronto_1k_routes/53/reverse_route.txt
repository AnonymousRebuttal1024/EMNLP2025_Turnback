**Confidence: 88%**

**Reason:** The navigation primarily takes place through PATH, which involves indoor and underground pathways in Toronto's downtown area, adding a layer of complexity due to potential lack of explicit geographical markers like streets. Nonetheless, the detailed instructions are leveraged to logically direct the reversal sequence step-by-step, thereby maintaining coherency. Minor complexity arises from potentially numerous, similarly-configured passages within PATH, contributing to marginally reduced confidence, though each directional instruction was carefully considered for accuracy.
