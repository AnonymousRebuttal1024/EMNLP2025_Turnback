Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be located in the Garden District area, east of downtown, based on the coordinates and the mention of Mutual and Wood Streets.  The many turns and varying distances suggest navigation through smaller streets. Granby Street serves as another landmark. While the "keep left" instructions introduce some ambiguity, I'm fairly confident in the reversed directions, as the route appears to follow a generally logical progression through the street network. Allan Gardens could be a nearby POI.
