Reasoning: This reverse route closely follows the original instructions.  The streets mentioned are known to me and their relative positions are accurate. The only slight uncertainty comes from minor variations in the exact turning points (slight left vs slight right), and very short segments (8.8 meters, for instance) could easily shift slightly depending on the exact GPS point and mapping data used. However, the overall route's logic is solid, given my knowledge of the area near the CN Tower and Harbourfront Centre.  The route passes near the Rogers Centre (SkyDome).
