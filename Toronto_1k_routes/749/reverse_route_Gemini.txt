Confidence: 80%

Reasoning:  This route seems to be in the King West/Liberty Village area, with Tecumseth Street as a good anchor point. While the numerous turns make it a bit complex, the relatively contained area and the presence of Tecumseth Street give me reasonable confidence. The lack of other named streets introduces some uncertainty. Potential landmarks or POIs could include the Exhibition Place grounds or Liberty Village's shops and restaurants.
