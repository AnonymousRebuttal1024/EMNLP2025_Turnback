Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the East York area, possibly near the Taylor-Massey Creek ravine based on the presence of Frankdale Avenue, Memorial Park Avenue, and Roosevelt Road. I'm quite confident about the main sections along these roads. The shorter segments and turns likely involve residential streets or smaller pathways.  Potential POIs might include Stan Wadlow Park, East York Memorial Arena, and residential homes.
