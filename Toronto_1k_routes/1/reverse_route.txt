**Confidence: 85%**

**Reason:** Although the instructions have been systematically reversed considering typical navigation logic, the multiple twists, turns, and changes in direction along with the trail (possibly an off-road path or less prominent route) can be challenging to navigate precisely, and local features such as small crossings along the Humber River Trail might affect navigation. My confidence stems from a consistent pattern in direction changes and identifiable segments like the long 462.0 meters stretch. However, given variations in trail paths and local conditions (e.g., closures on the Humber River Trail), a minor degree of uncertainty remains.
