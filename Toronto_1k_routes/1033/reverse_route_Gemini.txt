Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is in the Regent Park and Cabbagetown neighbourhoods of Toronto. The street names Gifford Street, Spruce Street, Parliament Street, and Woodward Evans Lane are all accurate for this area, giving me high confidence in the route reconstruction. Parliament Street acts as a major north-south anchor.  Woodward Evans Lane is a smaller street, correctly placed relative to the others.  The mix of short and long segments represents the mix of smaller residential streets and the arterial Parliament Street. Potential POIs include Regent Park, the shops and restaurants along Parliament Street, and the residential areas of Cabbagetown.
