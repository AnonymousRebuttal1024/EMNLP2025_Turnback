Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Riverdale neighborhood, east of the Don Valley Parkway. Howland Road and Langley Avenue are key streets in this area.  The multiple turns and relatively short distances suggest navigating the residential streets.  However, the "slight right/left" and "keep left/right" instructions add some ambiguity without a map. Potential POIs might include Riverdale Park East and residential properties.
