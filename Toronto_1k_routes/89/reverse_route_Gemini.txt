Confidence: 70%

Reason: This route involves a large number of turns and changes in direction, making it challenging to reverse with complete certainty, particularly given the inclusion of "King Liberty Bridge," which requires specific knowledge of its orientation and surrounding streets which I don't have. The distances also suggest a complex route possibly involving smaller side streets, which are harder to confidently reverse without a map.  The high number of turns decreases my confidence in accurately reversing the route without visual confirmation.  There is no information about nearby POIs due to the lack of familiar street names.
