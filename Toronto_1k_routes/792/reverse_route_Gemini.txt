Confidence: 70%

This is a very long and complex route with many turns, located east of the downtown core, seemingly around Leslieville and Riverdale, based on the coordinates and street names like Bain, Carlaw, Fenwick, Ellerbeck, and Browning. Knowing these streets helps, but the sheer number of turns and short, unnamed segments introduces considerable uncertainty. It's difficult to precisely visualize and reverse every single maneuver without being on the ground.  POIs might include Jimmie Simpson Park or businesses along Queen Street East.
