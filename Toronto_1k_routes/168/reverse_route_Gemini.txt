Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route is relatively simple and straightforward, with a clearly defined start and end point.  The use of Dubray Avenue provides some geographic context, suggesting a likely location in a residential area of Toronto's west end.  Reversing the directions is straightforward. My confidence is slightly reduced due to the reliance on absolute directions for some segments and the absence of additional landmarks or street names beyond Dubray Avenue, which could introduce minor positional uncertainties.
