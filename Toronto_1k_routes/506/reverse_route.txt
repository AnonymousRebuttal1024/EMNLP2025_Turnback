Confidence: 90%

Explanation: The directions mostly involve short segments and recognizable positional shifts. The route's simplicity, with markers like frequent turns and short distances, mitigates complex navigation errors, enhancing reversing confidence. Given its location in Toronto, the nascent start and end suggest passageways through residential vicinities close to arterial corridors like Dundas or Bloor Streets where local urban markers guide reorientation, thus amplifying navigational accuracy within this framework.
