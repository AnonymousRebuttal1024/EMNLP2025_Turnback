Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the Corktown/Regent Park area based on the coordinates and the mention of Sumach and Mark Streets. I know this general area, but the high number of turns, especially "slight" turns and short segments, makes it hard to mentally reconstruct and reverse with high confidence. Streets like Parliament St, Gerrard St E and Dundas St E are likely close by. Potential POIs could include the Regent Park Aquatic Centre, various small businesses, and residential buildings.  The complex nature of the route significantly lowers my confidence, as slight errors in reversing turns could quickly lead off course in such a dense urban environment.
