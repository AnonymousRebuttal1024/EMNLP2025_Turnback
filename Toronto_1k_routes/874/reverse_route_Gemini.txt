Explanation: This route is in the downtown core, near University Avenue and Dundas Street, based on the coordinates and the mention of Simcoe Street. I am very familiar with this area. The route involves a long stretch along a major street (likely University Ave), making the reversal fairly straightforward.  Potential POIs include the Eaton Centre, Dundas Square, City Hall, and numerous businesses and theatres.  The presence of Simcoe Street suggests proximity to hospitals and the University of Toronto.
