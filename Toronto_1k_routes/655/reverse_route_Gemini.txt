Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route appears to start near the intersection of Gerrard Street East and Sherbourne Street and head generally northeast towards the Cabbagetown area. The initial 348.6-meter segment likely follows Gerrard, and the subsequent right turn and 279.8-meter segment could be along Parliament Street.  The shorter segments and turns suggest navigating smaller, possibly residential streets.  I'm fairly confident due to the implied use of major streets like Gerrard and Parliament, but the several short, unnamed turns create some uncertainty about the exact reversed path.  Potential POIs might include businesses along Gerrard, residential buildings in Cabbagetown, or Allan Gardens, which is a short distance west of the starting point.
