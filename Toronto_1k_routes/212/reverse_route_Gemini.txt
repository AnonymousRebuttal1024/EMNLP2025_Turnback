Confidence: 90%

Reason: This route is complex with many short segments and numerous turns, some of which are slight or sharp. This makes precise reversal challenging, particularly without street names for most of the route.  The high number of short segments and the lack of easily identifiable landmarks (beyond the one street name near the end) reduce my confidence in the absolute accuracy of the reversed route. The area is likely residential, and there are few distinctive features besides houses and streets.
