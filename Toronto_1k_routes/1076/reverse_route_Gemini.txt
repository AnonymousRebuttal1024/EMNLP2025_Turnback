Head east, continue for 21.6 meters.
Turn right, continue for 957.4 meters.
Turn right onto Pabst Lane, continue for 6.5 meters.
Arrive at your destination, straight ahead, continue for 0.0 meters.

Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: Pabst Lane is a very short street, clearly identifiable on a map near the intersection of Victoria Park Avenue and Ellesmere Avenue. The long, straight section afterwards very likely follows Ellesmere Avenue itself. This limited set of clear instructions and identifiable roads allows for a highly confident reversal. Potential POIs are primarily commercial businesses along Ellesmere Avenue.
