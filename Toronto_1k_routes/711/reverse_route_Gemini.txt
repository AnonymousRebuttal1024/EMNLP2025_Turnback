Confidence: 75%

This route is in the Regal Heights neighbourhood, seemingly a reverse of a previous query. Having Lambertlodge Avenue, Melita Avenue, Larry Priestman Lane, Shaw Street, Marchmount Road and  Lt. John Roberts Kenmure confirms the location, boosting confidence. The many short, unnamed segments, however, make precise path reconstruction without visuals difficult.  Casa Loma and Regal Road Public School are potential landmarks.
