Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route is moderately complex with a number of turns and several short segments, especially near the end.  The reversal is fairly straightforward, but the numerous short segments and a few 'keep left/right' instructions near the end increase the potential for minor errors in the reversed directions. The street names (Dupont and Osler) are recognizable Toronto streets. The area is likely residential.
