Explanation: This route likely passes through parts of Toronto west of downtown, potentially including neighborhoods such as Weston or Mount Dennis, which are known for residential streets and parks. The route's navigation relies on key long stretches and distinct directional changes consistent with major thoroughfares and residential sidestreets. The significant straight path followed by a series of simpler turns supports a strong logic for reverse direction navigation. This structured approach and typical residential context enhance confidence in reversing the directions accurately.
