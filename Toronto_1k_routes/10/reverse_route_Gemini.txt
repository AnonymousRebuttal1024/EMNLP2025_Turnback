Explanation: This route is in Riverdale, east of the Don Valley.  The inclusion of street names like Ingham, Bain, Logan, and Withrow allows for a much more accurate reconstruction of the reverse route. I am very familiar with this residential area's street layout.  Potential POIs nearby include Withrow Park and Riverdale Park East.  The route likely navigates the residential streets just east of the Don Valley Parkway.
