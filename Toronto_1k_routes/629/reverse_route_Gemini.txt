Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route appears to start near the Beaches neighborhood, close to the waterfront and the Martin Goodman Trail. The Boardwalk, Martin Goodman Trail, Kingswood Road, and other mentioned streets are helpful landmarks in this area. The route seems to move generally northwest, away from the lake. I'm fairly confident in my reversal because of these clear landmarks, although some unnamed turns create a bit of uncertainty.  Potential POIs might include Beaches Park, the boardwalk itself, or residential buildings in the area. Kew Gardens is also likely not far from this route.
