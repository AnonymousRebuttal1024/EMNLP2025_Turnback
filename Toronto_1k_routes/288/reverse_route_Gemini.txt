Confidence: 80%

Reasoning:  This route is likely in the Greektown/Leslieville area of Toronto. Pape Avenue is a major north-south artery, and the presence of smaller streets like Badgerow and Filmic Lane, along with Boston Avenue, suggest a residential neighbourhood.  While the longer stretches on Pape and Boston Avenue provide good reference points, the shorter segments and turns are harder to be entirely sure about without a visual map. Some small corrections might be necessary in practice.  Potential POIs along or near this route might include Pape subway station, Withrow Park, and various restaurants and shops along Pape Avenue.  I have higher confidence in this route than the Annex one because it seems less meandering and relies on a more prominent arterial road.
