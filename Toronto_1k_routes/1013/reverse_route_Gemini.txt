Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the west end, potentially near High Park or Junction Triangle, given the coordinates.  The initial west and then left turn, combined with longer stretches and "keep left/right" instructions, suggests navigating larger arterial roads with curves and potentially some highway ramps.  I'm reasonably confident in the initial part of the reversed route, but the multiple "keep left/right" instructions make it harder to be precise without a visual map. These instructions could indicate highway on/off ramps or curved roads where precise angles are difficult to estimate. The lack of specific street names also reduces my confidence. I can't identify any major landmarks with certainty based on the provided information, though High Park or the rail corridor near Dundas West are possibilities depending on the exact location within this area.
