Reasoning: This route is likely in the Corktown neighbourhood, east of downtown. Mark Street, Carfrae Lane, and Sumach Street exist in this area and are consistent with the turns and distances. The presence of a lane (Carfrae) adds some complexity, but the overall route is fairly contained within a smaller area.  Potential POIs near this route could include Riverdale Farm and the various businesses and residential buildings in Corktown.
