Confidence: 70%

This area is residential, likely near the Don River based on the street names (Rivercourt, Woodville).  My confidence is around 70% because while the general direction and turns seem plausible for navigating a residential area in Toronto, without access to a map I can't be certain about the precise street names and distances or the existence of smaller lanes or alleys that might impact the optimal reverse route. I am also assuming a relatively standard grid pattern with some curving streets near the river, which may not be entirely accurate.  It's possible some adjustments would be needed in reality.
