Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route seems to be just west of Dufferin Street and south of Bloor Street West based on the coordinates and the mention of Lynd Avenue. The initial westward direction and then navigating some smaller streets makes me believe this could be a residential area. I'm fairly confident about the general direction and the stretch along Lynd Avenue, but the multiple short turns at the beginning introduce some uncertainty without street names or a visual map. POIs could include residential homes and perhaps small businesses along Dufferin Street.
