Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is in the Guildwood area of Scarborough, likely near the Guild Inn Estate. The mention of Midburn Avenue helps locate the area.  The relatively few turns make reversing the directions straightforward. The "keep left" introduces a small degree of uncertainty, but overall I'm quite confident. Landmarks could include residential homes, the Guild Inn Estate, or Guild Park and Gardens.
