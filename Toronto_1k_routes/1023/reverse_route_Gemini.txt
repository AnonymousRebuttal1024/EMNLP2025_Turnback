Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Yonge and Eglinton (Midtown) area, specifically near the intersection of Yonge and Soudan.  The presence of street names like Lillian Street, Soudan Avenue, and Redpath Avenue significantly increases my confidence, as these are all real and correctly positioned in that area. The numerous short segments and turns are typical of the residential streets in this neighbourhood.  The "sharp" turns likely indicate navigating smaller laneways or tight corners. Potential POIs near this route could include the shops and restaurants along Yonge Street, Eglinton subway station, or the residential areas surrounding Soudan.
