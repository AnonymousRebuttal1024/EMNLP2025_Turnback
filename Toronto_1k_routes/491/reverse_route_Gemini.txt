Confidence: 65%

Reasoning:  This is a very long and complex route, likely winding through residential streets. The presence of named streets like Crewe, Oak Park, Gledhill, King Edward, Coleridge, and Strathmore helps to anchor the route, suggesting a location in East York. However, the large number of short, unnamed segments makes it difficult to be highly confident in the reversal.  "Sharp left" and "slight left/right" turns are ambiguous without a visual aid. I'm less certain about the accuracy of this reversed route compared to simpler ones.
