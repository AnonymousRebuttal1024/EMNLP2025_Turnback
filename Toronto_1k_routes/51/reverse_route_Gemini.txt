Confidence: 92%

Reasoning: The reversal is largely accurate. The confidence is slightly reduced due to the presence of several sharp turns and a "slight" turn,  which may have minor variations depending on the specific GPS data and mapping service used. The route is near the Humber River, a significant landmark for the area.  However,  the exact placement of the turns on the river trail could be subject to slight variation.
