Explanation: Although the route navigates urban streets and lanes like Crawford Street, Shaw Street, and Hallam Street, common in Torontoâ€™s densely structured neighborhoods, the complexity of direction changes and presence of narrow lanes amplify challenges. This densely organized grid provides necessary precision and fidelity, though with intuitive street identifiers common to Toronto's urban landscape, confidence levels remain high amidst minor variances.
