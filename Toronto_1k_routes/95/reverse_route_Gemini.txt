Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route involves a mix of major and minor streets, with some less-prominent street names like Claude Avenue.  While the directions are relatively straightforward to reverse, the less familiar street names and the number of turns make perfect recall slightly less certain.  The reversal is logically consistent. The area is likely residential.  The presence of Indian Road, a recognizable street, helps increase confidence.  The high number of turns in the sequence slightly reduces the overall confidence.
