Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is relatively straightforward, involving a few turns along Vaughan Road and Kirknewton Road.  My mental map of Toronto is reasonably accurate for major roads like Vaughan, so I'm confident in the reversal.  I'm less certain about smaller residential streets like Kirknewton, but the short distances and the simple turns give me a high degree of confidence.
