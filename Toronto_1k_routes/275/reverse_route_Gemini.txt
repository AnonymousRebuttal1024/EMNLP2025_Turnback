Nursewood Road provides a good anchor, and the relatively few turns, combined with the "sharp left," make the route fairly clear. This area is in the east end near The Beaches. Potential landmarks might include residential properties or the nearby shops and restaurants along Queen St E.  The "keep right/left" instructions suggest curves or forks where it's important to maintain a general direction.
