Explanation: The reversal recognizes crucial landmarks and directions along Ashtonbee Road and Thermos Road, typical of the industrially zoned districts in Scarborough. Implementing precise direction inversions within what is potentially an industrial area, i.e., Toolross Park, enables structured navigation via the area's layout known for distinct, rectilinear road transitions. Predicated upon the routeâ€™s logical progression and directional balance typical of this geographic context, high confidence underpins accurate path reversal.
