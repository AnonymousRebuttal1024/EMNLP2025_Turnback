Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be in the Yorkdale-Glen Park neighbourhood, with Replin Road and Flemington Road being the primary streets.  The presence of these street names gives me high confidence, especially as the route is relatively straightforward. The few turns and longer distances are also easier to track. Potential landmarks might include the Downsview Airport, which is relatively close by, although likely not directly visible from this route, and residential areas.
