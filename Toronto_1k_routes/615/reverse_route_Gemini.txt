Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the Little Italy/Trinity-Bellwoods area, starting near Clinton Street and heading northwest towards Bathurst Street.  The inclusion of Clinton Street, Mansfield Avenue, Marchese Lane, and Manning Avenue greatly increases my confidence in the accuracy of the reverse route. The numerous turns suggest navigating a residential area with smaller streets and laneways.  Potential landmarks include Trinity Bellwoods Park, the shops and restaurants along College Street, and the residential buildings of Little Italy.
