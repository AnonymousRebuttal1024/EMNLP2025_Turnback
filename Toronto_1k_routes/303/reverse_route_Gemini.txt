Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Lytton Park neighbourhood. Greer Road and Chatsworth Drive are located in this area, and Duplex Avenue is a major north-south arterial road.  The presence of the Chatsworth Ravine Trail suggests the route goes through or near a ravine area, a common feature in midtown Toronto.  The relatively few turns and the presence of Duplex Avenue increase my confidence.  Potential POIs could include Lytton Park itself and residential buildings.
