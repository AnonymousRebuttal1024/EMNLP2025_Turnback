Confidence: 98%

Reasoning: My confidence is 98% because this route is relatively straightforward with a clear starting and ending point on named streets (Krawchuk Lane and Thorncliffe Park Drive).  These are significant landmarks.  The distances are also reasonably clear, and the reversal is a direct mirroring of directions.  The only possible source of minor error would be slight misinterpretations of the 'slight right' and 'keep right/left' instructions, but the overall path is easy to reverse with high accuracy given the landmarks.
