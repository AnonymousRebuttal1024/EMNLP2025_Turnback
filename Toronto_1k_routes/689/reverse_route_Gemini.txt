Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in The Beaches, possibly starting near Kew Gardens and ending near Woodbine Beach.  Parkway Avenue, Sheridan Avenue, Awde Street and Fisher Street are helpful anchors. The many short segments and turns towards the beginning suggest navigation through the residential streets closer to Queen Street East. The longer stretches in the middle likely utilize roads closer to the lakefront. I'm reasonably confident thanks to the street names, but the complexity makes precise reversal a bit challenging without visual aids.  Potential landmarks would be Kew Gardens, Woodbine Beach Park, and the shops and restaurants along Queen Street East.
