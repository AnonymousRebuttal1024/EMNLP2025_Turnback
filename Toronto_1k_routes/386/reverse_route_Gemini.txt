Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route likely starts near Christie Pits park and goes towards the Corso Italia neighborhood.  The street names (Wychcrest, Melita, Hector, Dartnell) suggest a residential area.  I'm fairly confident in the main stretch along what seems to be a major road (judging by the 587m segment), but the initial and final parts of the route with short segments and unnamed roads introduce some uncertainty. Potential POIs include Christie Pits Park and the shops and restaurants along St. Clair Avenue West.
