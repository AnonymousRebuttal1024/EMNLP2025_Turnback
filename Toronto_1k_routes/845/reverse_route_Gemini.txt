Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: McDougall Lane provides a clear landmark.  The relatively few turns and the long straight segments increase my confidence.  "Keep left" and "slight left" are likely minor course corrections on a main road. Potential POIs include residential buildings and potentially some small businesses along McDougall Lane, but without cross-streets, it's difficult to be more specific. Based on my knowledge of Toronto, the location is likely somewhere in the west end, possibly near King West or the Entertainment District, based on the shorter street names and proximity to what might be major arterial roads based on the longer segments.
