Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: The reversal is fairly straightforward, but the confidence is slightly reduced due to the "slight left" and "slight right" turns, which are subjective and could vary slightly depending on the mapping data and the exact GPS coordinates used. The route is near the High Park area of Toronto, but no specific landmarks are directly on it.  The presence of King Georges Drive helps in the accuracy of the reverse route.
