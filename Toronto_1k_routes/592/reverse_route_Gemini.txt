This route appears to be in the Jane and Finch area, specifically in the University Heights neighborhood. The presence of Dubray Avenue, Tilbury Drive, Bayford Avenue, and Stanley Greene Boulevard strongly anchors this route. This area is predominantly residential with a mix of housing types.  I'm fairly certain of the reverse directions due to the specific street names provided, and I assume "slight left" is roughly equivalent to "slight right" in reverse.  Potential landmarks in this area could include schools, community centers, and local parks.
