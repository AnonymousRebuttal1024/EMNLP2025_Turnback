Confidence: 85%

Reasoning:  My confidence is 85% because while I can reverse the simple directional turns,  I'm less certain about the exact street names and distances involved in a small area of Toronto without access to real-time mapping data. The route involves short segments and minor street turns, making precise reversal slightly challenging based solely on the provided instructions. I am assuming Hertle Avenue is a relatively short street and the turns are approximate.  The lack of specific landmarks in the instructions also reduces my confidence.  If more details about nearby buildings, intersections or points of interest had been included, my confidence would be higher.
