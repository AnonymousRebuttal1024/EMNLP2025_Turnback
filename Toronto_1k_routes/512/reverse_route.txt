Explanation: The route navigates areas with unique topology like roundabouts and varied intersections along residential streets such as Rosewell Avenue and Cheritan Avenue, suggesting the neighborhood north of Lawrence Park. The organized grid layout aids in precise reversing, though variability in traffic conditions and area-specific road features (for example, the roundabout) contribute to a slight complexity in ensuring absolute directional correctness. The confidence remains high but considers these subtle navigational nuances.
