Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to be at the very south end of the Leslie Street Spit (Tommy Thompson Park). "Spit Singletrack" and "Construction Access Road" suggest an off-road, undeveloped area, which is characteristic of the southern part of the Spit. I'm reasonably confident about the general location and the segments involving the named paths, but less sure about the precise turns without a visual map, especially the "sharp left."  Landmarks would mainly be natural features like the lake, the shoreline, and possibly some construction or maintenance areas.
