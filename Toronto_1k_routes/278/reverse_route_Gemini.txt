Blackthorn Avenue and Chambers Avenue provide solid anchors, and the numerous "keep left/right" instructions suggest following a curving road or path, possibly within a residential area. This is in the west end, near the Humber River valley and the Old Mill.  Potential landmarks include the Old Mill, Etienne Brule Park, and the residential areas nearby.
