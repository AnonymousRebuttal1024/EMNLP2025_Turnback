Confidence: 90%

This short route appears to be in the area just north of Bloor Street West, between Christie Street and Bathurst Street. While there are no street names provided, the few turns and relatively straight segments make it easier to reverse.  I am fairly confident in the reversed directions, with the caveat that "sharp right" has been interpreted as "slight left", assuming it's not a full 180-degree turn. It's difficult to pinpoint specific landmarks without more detailed location information, but the area likely contains a mix of residential and commercial buildings.
