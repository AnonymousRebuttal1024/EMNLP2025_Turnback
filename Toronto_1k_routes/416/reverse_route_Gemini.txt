Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route seems to be near the Distillery District and potentially heading towards the downtown core. The many short turns at the beginning suggest a complex start in a possibly mixed-use area.  The 697.4-meter segment suggests a longer stretch on a major road like Eastern Avenue or King Street East.  However, without street names, it's challenging to be completely confident in the reversal. POIs might include the Distillery District, or perhaps St. James Park depending on the exact route.
