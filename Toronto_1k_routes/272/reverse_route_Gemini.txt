Confidence: 95%

The street names (Regina Avenue, Rajah Street, Ridgevale Drive) and the relatively few, well-defined turns make me quite confident in this reversal. This area is in the northwest part of the city, near York University, and appears residential. Potential landmarks might include residential buildings, parks, or local businesses along the named streets.
