Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route appears to begin just southwest of the intersection of Victoria Park Avenue and St. Clair Avenue East. The long 746.8 meter segment strongly suggests a significant portion of St. Clair Avenue East itself, while the sharp right turn after implies turning north onto a major road, perhaps Victoria Park Avenue. The shorter initial segments seem to navigate smaller local streets or a parking lot before reaching St. Clair. I'm reasonably confident given the likely use of major streets, but the limited number of steps and lack of specific street names (besides the inference of St. Clair and potentially Victoria Park) leave some room for error. Potential POIs include businesses along St. Clair East and residential buildings.
