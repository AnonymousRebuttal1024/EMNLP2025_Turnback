Confidence: 85%

The inclusion of street names (Oriole Gardens and Birch Avenue) significantly increases my confidence. These streets are in the area north of St. Clair West, and south of Eglinton Avenue West and fairly clearly suggest residential areas, likely with a mix of houses and possibly some low-rise apartments.  The long stretch on Oriole Gardens and the shorter segment on Birch Avenue suggest a main road and side street connection. While the initial turns might have some ambiguity, the clear street names and longer, straighter segments afterwards make the reversed route relatively easy to determine with good confidence.  While I can't pinpoint exact landmarks, the proximity to both St. Clair and Eglinton suggests access to retail and transit options within a reasonable distance.
