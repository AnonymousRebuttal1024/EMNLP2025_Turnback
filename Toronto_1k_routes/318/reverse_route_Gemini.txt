Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to originate near the intersection of Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue, progressing southward. The initial 880.0-meter stretch southward suggests a significant portion along Yonge Street. The subsequent left turn and further southward movements point towards the area around Blythwood Ravine. Elwood Boulevard, existing in this region, lends credence to the directions. However, the absence of other distinct street names, combined with 'keep right' instructions, introduces some uncertainty, particularly concerning the precise paths through intersections and along unnamed roads. Notable POIs near this route could include the Lawrence subway station, businesses along Yonge Street, and the scenic Blythwood Ravine Park.
