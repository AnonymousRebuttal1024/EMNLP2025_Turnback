Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is along the lakeshore in the Humber Bay/Mimico area. Marine Parade Drive is a clear landmark along the waterfront, making the reversal straightforward.  The other turns are likely on smaller residential streets close to the lake. Humber Bay Park East and the Humber Bay Arch Bridge are likely POIs near this route.  The presence of Marine Parade Drive and the relative simplicity of the route give me high confidence.
