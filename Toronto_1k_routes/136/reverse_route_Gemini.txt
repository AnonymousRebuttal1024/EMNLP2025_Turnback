Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route is relatively short and involves a series of turns. Reversing the directions is straightforward. The mention of "Canada Boulevard" helps to ground the route in a specific area. However, the numerous slight turns and short distances might slightly increase the possibility of minor variations compared to a longer route with more defined landmarks or major streets.  The confidence level reflects this potential for minor inaccuracies in the reversed route.
