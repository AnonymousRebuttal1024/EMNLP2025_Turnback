Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route appears to start south of Dundas St E, near Church Street and head generally northeast. Frederick Street is a good landmark.  The other streets are likely smaller, local streets in the area. I'm relatively confident in the reversal due to Frederick Street anchoring the route and the relatively straightforward turns, however, without more named streets, thereâ€™s a slight chance of minor inaccuracies. Potential POIs could include businesses along Church Street or Yonge Street (which is close by), and possibly residential buildings as the route heads north.
