Confidence: 85%

The long 709.9 meter segment suggests a major road, possibly Carlaw Avenue.  This provides some context, although the lack of specific street names throughout reduces certainty.  The "slight left" and "keep left/right" directions introduce some ambiguity. This is near Riverdale Park East, so that is a likely landmark, as well as the residential areas surrounding it.
