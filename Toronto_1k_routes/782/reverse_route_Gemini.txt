This route is fairly simple, with only two main turns. The coordinates suggest it's likely in the Seaton Village area, possibly near Christie Pits Park. The "keep left/right" instructions probably indicate slight curves or bends in the road, rather than sharp turns.  The lack of street names makes it a bit harder to be absolutely certain, but the overall pattern is easy to reverse. Christie Pits Park itself is a likely POI, along with the businesses along Bloor Street West.
