**Reason:** The instructions feature several tight turns and distinct road names like Blakley Avenue, Ravenal Street, and Henrietta Street, guiding path navigation precisely. The sequence involves complex turns that require attentive navigation. Urban transitions give rise to some variability possibilities, but the explicit nature of directional segments supports the coherent logical mapping of actions to maintain high confidence during reversals.
