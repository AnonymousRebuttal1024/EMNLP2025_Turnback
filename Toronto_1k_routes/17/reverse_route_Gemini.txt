Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the Weston/Mount Dennis area of Toronto. I'm quite confident because the route includes major streets like Sir William Hearst Avenue, Falstaff Avenue and Erie Street, which are all real and follow a logical pattern in that area.  The distances and turns also make sense for this residential/light industrial neighborhood. I am aware that Sir William Hearst Avenue runs roughly east-west, and Falstaff and Erie have a more north-south orientation. Potential POIs near this route might include the Weston GO Station, or some of the industrial businesses along Weston Road.
