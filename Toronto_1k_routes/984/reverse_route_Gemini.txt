Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the Junction area, likely near Dundas Street West and Keele Street.  McCormack Street is a residential street in that neighborhood.  The 475-meter segment likely follows a major road, perhaps Dundas Street West or Bloor Street West.  The presence of a named street increases my confidence, although the shorter segments suggest potential pedestrian shortcuts or slightly off-road paths. This area is primarily residential with some commercial establishments along the main roads.
