Confidence: 60%

This route appears to be in the Parkdale neighborhood, possibly near Queen Street West and Dufferin Street. I am somewhat familiar with the general grid pattern in the area, but the lack of specific street names and the many short segments and turns make me less confident about the precise route.  It seems to be a complex pedestrian path potentially going through smaller streets, laneways, or even private property.  The area is a mix of residential, commercial, and some light industrial uses.
