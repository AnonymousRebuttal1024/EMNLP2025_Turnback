Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route is relatively simple, involving only a few turns.  The starting and ending coordinates suggest a location near Eastern Avenue and Coxwell Avenue in Toronto. My mental map of that area, combined with the straightforward directions, gives me high confidence in the reversed directions.  POIs near this route could include the Coxwell subway station, several small businesses along Eastern Avenue, and potentially residential buildings.
