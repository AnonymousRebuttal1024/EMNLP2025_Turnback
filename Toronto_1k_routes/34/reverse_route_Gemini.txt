Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: My confidence is 75% because this route is quite long and involves numerous short segments and turns,  making precise reversal challenging without a visual map. While the inclusion of several street names (Drayton Avenue, Strathmore Boulevard, Monarch Park Avenue, Glebeholme Boulevard, Linnsmore Crescent, Queensdale Avenue, Sammon Avenue) improves confidence, the numerous "turn left/right" and "keep left/right" instructions, especially in the latter half, create some uncertainty regarding the exact distances and positions of turns in the reversed route.  The general area is familiar but the numerous short segments without strong landmarks reduce my confidence.
