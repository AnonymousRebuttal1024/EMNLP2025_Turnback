Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route is in Liberty Village. The mention of Atlantic Avenue, Hanna Avenue, Garrison Crossing, and Garrison Road makes me confident in the general area.  The turns seem to navigate the somewhat industrial and grid-like layout there. The 423m stretch likely runs parallel to the railway tracks that go through Liberty Village.  I'm fairly certain about the reversal, given the landmark streets. Potential POIs include the Liberty Village Market, various restaurants, and the Exhibition Place grounds to the south.
