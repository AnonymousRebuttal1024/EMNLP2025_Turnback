Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: My confidence is 80% because the route includes named streets (Apricot Lane and Wineva Avenue) which are helpful landmarks. However, the numerous short segments and turns make precise reversal more difficult without detailed street-level mapping data.  The use of "slight left" also introduces some uncertainty in the exact turning point. I am reasonably confident in the overall route reversal but acknowledge a margin of error due to the lack of precise visual context for this part of Toronto.
