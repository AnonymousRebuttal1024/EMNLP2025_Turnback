Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: The coordinates suggest a location near Dundas West and Runnymede, likely involving a walk southward and then eastward.  The relatively few instructions and the short distances increase my confidence in the overall reversal.  While I don't have street names, I'm fairly certain the route starts near Dundas St W, heads south, likely across the train tracks, and then makes a right turn. Possible landmarks near this route are the Runnymede Public Library or the shops along Dundas St West.
