Explanation: This route appears to start near Pape and Cosburn Avenues, heading generally east, possibly towards the Don Valley Parkway, based on the coordinates and the long 1161.5-meter segment.  I'm familiar with the major roads in that area, and the initial part of the route seems straightforward.  The "keep left" and "slight left" instructions introduce some uncertainty.  POIs might include residential buildings, potentially parks along the Don River if the route goes that far east, and businesses along Pape or Mortimer Avenues.
