This route appears to be within a park or a green space given the lack of specific street names.  The turns are relatively straightforward, increasing confidence.  While I can't name specific POIs without more context, if this is indeed a park area, there might be playgrounds, trails, or recreational facilities nearby.  Don Valley Golf Course is also close.
