Confidence: 70%

Explanation:  This route appears to be around the Bloor and Spadina area. I'm fairly confident about the initial and final legs based on the provided coordinates suggesting an east-west traversal near Bloor.  Shanly Street is a key indicator. However, the multiple short turns in the middle suggest navigating smaller side streets, which are harder to pinpoint without a visual map.  I'm assuming the route avoids major obstacles and utilizes the most direct path along the grid layout prevalent in that area. Potential POIs near this route could include shops and restaurants along Bloor St West, possibly residential areas along Shanly Street.
