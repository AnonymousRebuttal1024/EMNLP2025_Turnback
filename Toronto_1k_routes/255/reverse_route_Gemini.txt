Confidence: 95%

The inclusion of Martin Road and Balliol Street greatly increases my confidence. These specific street names allow me to pinpoint the location more accurately. The relatively clear turns also help. This route is in midtown Toronto, close to Yonge Street and likely residential. Potential landmarks could include local businesses on Yonge Street, or perhaps a nearby school or park.
