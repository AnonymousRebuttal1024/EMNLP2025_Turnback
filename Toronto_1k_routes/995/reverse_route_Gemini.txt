Confidence: 70%

This route seems to be near the Entertainment District and potentially extends towards the Fashion District, given the coordinates. The numerous short segments and changes in direction suggest a complex pedestrian route, potentially through smaller streets, alleyways, or even within building complexes. The lack of specific street names makes it harder to confirm the precise path and therefore reduces my confidence in the reversed directions.  This area has a mix of commercial, entertainment, and some residential properties.
