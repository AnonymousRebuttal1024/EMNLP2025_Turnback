This route seems to be in the Thorncliffe Park neighborhood, generally heading north and then east.  The lack of street names makes precise location identification difficult. The longer straight stretch suggests following a major road, perhaps Overlea Boulevard or Millwood Road, while the other segments likely involve smaller residential streets. The presence of "sharp" turns indicate significant direction changes, though their exact angles are unclear, and I've assumed less sharp turns ("slight") in the reverse. Without street names, landmarks are hard to specify, but Thorncliffe Park is known for its apartment buildings and diverse community. Potential landmarks might include the Thorncliffe Park Public Library or the East York Town Centre if the route extends further south.
