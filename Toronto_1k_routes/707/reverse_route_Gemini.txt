Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be in the Riverdale neighbourhood, near the intersection of Dundas Street East and Jones Avenue.  The presence of Dundas Street East and Jones Avenue provides a strong anchor for this location and makes me quite confident in the reversal.  With these major streets identified, the rest of the shorter segments likely represent navigation through smaller residential streets in the area.  Potential landmarks could include the shops and restaurants along Dundas Street East or Withrow Park a few blocks to the north.
