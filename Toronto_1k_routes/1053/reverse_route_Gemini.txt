Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route seems to start near the intersection of Broadview Avenue and Gerrard Street East, based on the provided coordinates and my understanding of Toronto's street network. Sandford Avenue is a real street in that area, which adds to my confidence.  The initial eastward direction on Sandford, followed by a series of shorter segments and turns, suggests navigation through the residential streets east of the Don Valley Parkway. The longer "keep right" segment of 733.8 meters might correspond to a stretch along a major road like Mortimer Avenue or possibly even a portion of the Don Valley Parkway itself if the route curves northward. The lack of further street names makes precise route reconstruction somewhat uncertain, particularly for the later segments. Potential POIs could include the shops and restaurants along the Danforth, the Don Valley trails, or the residential areas surrounding this route.
