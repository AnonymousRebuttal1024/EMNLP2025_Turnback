Confidence: 98%

Reason: The route is simple and linear, involving a sequence of clearly defined turns. Reversing it is very straightforward.  The distances are plausible, and the lack of street names doesn't impact the reversal as the directions are predominantly compass-based.  My high confidence stems from the ease of reversing the steps and the clear, unambiguous instructions provided.  The route likely is in a residential or less densely developed area of Toronto, given the lack of street name references.
