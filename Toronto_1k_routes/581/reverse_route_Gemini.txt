Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the East York area, potentially near Coxwell Avenue and O'Connor Drive.  The inclusion of Coxwell Avenue helps to ground the route. The many short segments and turns indicate a possibly residential or mixed-use area with smaller streets.  The long stretch after Coxwell Avenue suggests a major road.  I'm reasonably confident in the reversal, especially with the inclusion of Coxwell Avenue, though the multiple very short segments make precise reconstruction challenging, and the lack of other street names reduces certainty. Potential landmarks could include residential buildings, small businesses, and possibly parks in the vicinity.
