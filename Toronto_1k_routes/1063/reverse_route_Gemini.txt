Confidence: 85%

Reasoning:  The inclusion of Baldwin Street and Cecil Street greatly aids in identifying the location - this route is in the Kensington Market area, known for its maze-like streets and unique shops. Knowing these streets helps me establish a solid framework for the reversal, and the shorter segments between turns make the reversed directions reasonably reliable.  However, Kensington Market's irregular street layout still introduces a small element of uncertainty for a few of the very short segments.  Potential POIs near this route include the many vintage clothing stores, cafes, and restaurants in Kensington Market, as well as possibly Bellevue Square Park.
