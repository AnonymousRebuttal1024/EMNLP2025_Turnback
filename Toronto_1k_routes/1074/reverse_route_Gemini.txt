Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: The numerous street names, including Salisbury Avenue, Millington Street, Metcalfe Street, Broadcast Lane, Berkeley Street, Callaghan Lane, and Ontario Street, significantly improve my ability to trace the route. This path appears to weave through the Corktown and Distillery District neighborhoods, just east of downtown. While the many turns and short distances introduce some potential for minor inaccuracies in the reversed directions, the specific street names provide a strong framework for the reversal.  POIs near this route include the various restaurants, galleries, and shops in the Distillery District, as well as potentially St. James Park further west.
