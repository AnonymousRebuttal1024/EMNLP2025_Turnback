Confidence: 85%

Reason: The route involves a significant number of turns and street names that are not highly familiar to me (Blakley Avenue, Ravenal Street, Henrietta Street).  While the distances seem reasonable for a residential area, the complexity and lack of strong mental image of the precise layout in that area lead to a moderate confidence level. The reversal is logically sound, but the lack of familiarity with those particular streets makes it difficult to be completely sure of the order of turns without visual aid. The area is likely residential, so POIs would be residential buildings.
