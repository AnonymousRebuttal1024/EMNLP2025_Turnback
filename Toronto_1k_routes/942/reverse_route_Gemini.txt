Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Birch Cliff neighborhood of Scarborough, based on street names like Beech Avenue, Fallingbrook Road, Blantyre Avenue, and the general area based on the coordinates.  I'm reasonably confident about the beginning and end segments because of the specific street names, but the many turns and the "keep left/right" instructions make precise reconstruction difficult without a map. I'm unsure about some of the smaller streets or lanes that could be involved. Landmarks might include residential homes, Birch Cliff Public School, or possibly some shops along Kingston Road to the south.
