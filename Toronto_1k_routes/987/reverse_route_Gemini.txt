Confidence: 75%

This route appears to be in the Runnymede/Bloor West Village area.  Runnymede Road is a prominent north-south street in that neighborhood. The numerous "keep left/right" instructions and shorter segments suggest navigation through potentially complex intersections or along pedestrian paths that don't perfectly align with the road network.  High Park is a potential landmark nearby, though the route's exact relation to the park isn't clear.  The presence of Runnymede Road increases my confidence, but the complexity of the turns reduces it somewhat.
