Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the North York area near the intersection of Sheppard Avenue East and Bayview Avenue. "Wellness Way" and "Rapert Avenue" provide good location clues, although I'm not personally familiar with these streets. The sequence of "keep right" instructions suggests a curving road or path, possibly within a park or a residential complex.  Potential landmarks might include the Bayview Village Shopping Centre or the Bessarion subway station, depending on the exact location. The presence of named streets increases my confidence.
