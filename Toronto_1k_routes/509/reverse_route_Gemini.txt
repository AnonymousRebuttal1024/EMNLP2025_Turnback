Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route likely traverses a residential area, possibly near Yonge and St. Clair based on the street names (Ardmore, Rosemary, Glenayr, Strathearn, Vesta, Millbank). The inclusion of these names provides good anchors, and the distances suggest navigation along a mix of main and smaller streets. The "slight right" and "sharp left" instructions introduce ambiguity. The repeating Vesta Drive suggests a possible loop or a street with a bend.  I'm fairly confident in the sections along the named streets, but the unnamed segments and ambiguous turns reduce my certainty.
