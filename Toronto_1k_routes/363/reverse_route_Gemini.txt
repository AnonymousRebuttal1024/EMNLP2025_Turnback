Explanation:  This route seems to be in Scarborough, in the Guildwood area. Craigton Drive is a good indicator.  The long westward and eastward segments suggest travelling along major roads, perhaps Kingston Road or Guildwood Parkway. The turns are likely onto smaller residential streets. Potential POIs might include Guildwood GO Station, the Guild Inn Estate (slightly north), and residential homes.  I'm quite confident given the presence of Craigton Drive and the relatively straightforward turns.
