Explanation: The course involves direct paths across known corridors such as Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto's Entertainment District, emphasizing coherent back-and-forth sequences within a highly frequented area with a straightforward urban layout. Expanding directional contrasts strives prudently against potential interaction down these mainstream avenues, lending strong directional anchorage concurrent with credible urban path retracement in organized routes.
