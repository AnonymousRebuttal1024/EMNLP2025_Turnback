Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route description is fairly straightforward and involves relatively simple turns and street segments.  I am confident in my ability to reverse the directions accurately.  The only potential for error would be in slight variations in the actual turning points,  but the overall street sequence and direction are clearly understandable.  The streets mentioned (Leslie Street, Sandford Avenue etc.) are recognizable Toronto streets.  There is a park nearby (potentially Moore Park).
