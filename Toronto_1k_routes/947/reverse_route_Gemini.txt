Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Riverdale neighborhood, east of the Don Valley Parkway. Kenilworth Avenue anchors the start of the route, and the long 648.1-meter segment suggests a major road, likely Queen Street East or Gerrard Street East.  The relatively few turns and the presence of Kenilworth make reversing the directions fairly straightforward.  Potential landmarks might include residential buildings, Withrow Park, or businesses along Queen Street East.
