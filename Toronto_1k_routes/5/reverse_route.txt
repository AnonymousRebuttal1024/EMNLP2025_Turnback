**Confidence: 90%**

**Reason:** This route is straightforward, involving a series of linear progressions with clearly defined turns. The nature of urban navigation between lanes and pathways, such as Ditty Lane, provides distinct and manageable segments to reverse. Additionally, key directional shifts (left/right) follow expected reversal logic, helping to maintain a high confidence in navigating back accurately along the path. Potential local variations due to urban infrastructure exist, but the prominence of precise turns and paths can keep certainty relatively high.
