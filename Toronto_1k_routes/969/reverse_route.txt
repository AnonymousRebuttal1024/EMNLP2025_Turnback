Explanation: The route covers Gould Street and Nelson Mandela Walk, areas central to Toronto's downtown possibly within or around the Ryerson University campus. Given the straight linear passages and precise maneuver field steps suitably established, path reversals are intuitively supported along publicly access-ready environments, considering built environments typical for educational complexes sustaining structured processing benefits under known geographic patterns.
