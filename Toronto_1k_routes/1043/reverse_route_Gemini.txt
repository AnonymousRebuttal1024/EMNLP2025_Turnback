Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is in the Corso Italia neighborhood, nestled between St. Clair West and Davenport Road. The abundance of street names - Brandon Avenue, Primrose Avenue, Via Italia (St. Clair Ave W), Nunes Lane, McFarland Avenue, and Peterborough Avenue - provides strong anchors and significantly boosts confidence.  The many turns and varied segment lengths suggest a winding route through the primarily residential streets of this area. POIs might include the shops and restaurants along St. Clair West, the residential architecture of the neighborhood, and possibly Earlscourt Park if the route extends far enough west.
