Confidence: 92%

Reason: The route is reasonably well-defined with street names and directions.  Reversing it is straightforward.  My confidence is slightly reduced because the route seems to involve a loop back on Fleming Crescent which requires careful attention to the directions to ensure accuracy in the reverse. The presence of Fleming Crescent and Belcourt Road provides some geographical context, suggesting a location in a residential area of Toronto, though the exact location is not immediately obvious.  The short distances and slight turns might introduce a marginal uncertainty in perfect duplication of the route.
