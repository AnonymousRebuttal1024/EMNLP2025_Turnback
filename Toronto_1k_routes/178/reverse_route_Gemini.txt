Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route involves several turns and distances, and  includes the street names Dieppe Road and Memorial Park Avenue, which helps to place the route in a specific part of Toronto.  However, the multiple short segments and the “slight right” and “sharp left” turns introduce some uncertainty, especially when reversing the route.  My confidence is reduced because of potential variations in interpretation of these turns, particularly in a real-world setting.  The route is likely in a residential area.
