Confidence: 90%

This route is likely in the Deer Park neighborhood, near the intersection of Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue.  The inclusion of Edmund Avenue, Clarendon Avenue, Poplar Plains Road, and Warren Road makes me highly confident in the location and reversed directions. This area is primarily residential with upscale homes and mature trees.  Potential landmarks might include the shops and restaurants along Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue.  The route likely traverses the quieter residential streets characteristic of Deer Park.
