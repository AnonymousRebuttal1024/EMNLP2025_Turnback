Confidence: 85%

Reason: The route involves several smaller streets and a number of turns, which makes the precise reversal slightly less certain without visual reference. The street names (Kenilworth Avenue, Kewbeach Avenue, Lee Avenue, Balsam Avenue, Fir Avenue, Park Avenue) seem plausible for Toronto, but I don't know the exact layout of these smaller streets in relation to each other with absolute certainty. The distances are reasonable. The reversal is logically sound, but the lack of absolute certainty about the street network in that specific area lowers the confidence level.  There is limited information about nearby POIs due to the less familiar street names.  The area is likely residential.
