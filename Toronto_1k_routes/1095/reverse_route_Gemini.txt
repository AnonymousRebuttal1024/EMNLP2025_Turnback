Reasoning: Northline Road, Wakunda Place, Parma Court, and St. Clair Avenue East provide strong anchors, placing this route in the Upper Beaches/East York area, near Warden Avenue. The named streets offer good reference points. The multiple turns and some shorter segments introduce a bit of uncertainty, but the street names make the reversal quite reliable overall. Potential POIs might include local businesses and residential areas, possibly the Warden Hilltop Community Centre, depending on the exact route.
