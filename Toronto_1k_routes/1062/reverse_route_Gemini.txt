Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: The mention of the Riverdale Meadow Trail makes me quite confident about the general location and direction. This trail is in Riverdale Park East, close to Broadview Ave. I am fairly certain about the initial southward direction and the long stretch along a likely major road before the park. The other small turns at the beginning are harder to be completely certain about without street names, but the distances are short, so significant errors are less likely.  POIs nearby would include Riverdale Park East itself, potentially the Don Valley Parkway, and depending on the exact route, possibly the Riverdale Farm.
