Explanation: The route spans a series of turns through Curzon Street and nearby lanes. The reverse navigation is marked by clear directional changes, aided by distinct street names like Sproat Avenue and Peyton Lane. Its relative complexity due to the number of turns introduces minor directional uncertainties, hence the moderate confidence level. Moreover, the area situated in residential parts of Leslieville enhances navigation as the environment remains consistent yet unfamiliar variations could subtly impact precision.
