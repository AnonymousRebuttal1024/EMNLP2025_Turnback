Explanation: This route appears to start near Exhibition Place and head generally north towards Liberty Village. Heenan Place is a good locator.  The mixture of longer and shorter segments suggests a combination of main roads and smaller streets. However, the multiple "Keep Left/Right" instructions and lack of street names for several turns make the exact path somewhat ambiguous. These could represent curves, forks in the road, or even paths within a park.  Potential POIs include Exhibition Place venues, parks along the waterfront (like Coronation Park), and the residential and commercial buildings of Liberty Village.
