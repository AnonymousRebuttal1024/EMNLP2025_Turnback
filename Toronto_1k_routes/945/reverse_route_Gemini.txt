Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Runnymede/Bloor West Village area, starting near the intersection of Runnymede and Dundas West and moving south towards Bloor West Village.  The street names Runnymede Road, Henrietta Street and Ravenal Street help anchor the route. The frequent "keep left/right" instructions, however, introduce uncertainty, as they could represent small residential streets or laneways that are difficult to precisely identify without a visual map. Potential landmarks might include residential homes, Runnymede Public School, or the shops and restaurants along Bloor Street West.
