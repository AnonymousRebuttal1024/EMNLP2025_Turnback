Confidence: 95%

The inclusion of St. Clair Avenue West, Westmount Avenue, Glenholme Avenue, and Rosemount Avenue makes me very confident in the location and reversal. This area is in the Wychwood neighborhood, a primarily residential area known for its charming homes and proximity to Casa Loma.  St. Clair Avenue West is a major east-west arterial road, and the other streets are smaller residential streets in the area. The turns and distances suggest a fairly typical residential grid pattern. While "sharp left" and "slight right" introduce minor uncertainties, the named streets provide strong anchors for a highly reliable reversal. Casa Loma is a prominent landmark within a reasonable distance.
