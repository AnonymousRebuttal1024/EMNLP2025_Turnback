Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is in the West Queen West/Trinity Bellwoods area, close to the intersection of Dundas St W and Dovercourt Road. The inclusion of Dovercourt Road, Mackenzie Crescent, Lisgar Street, Antonio Lopes Lane, Argyle Street, Gladstone Avenue and Alma Avenue greatly strengthens my confidence, as these are accurate and correctly sequenced street names. The multiple turns and short distances suggest a winding path through this largely residential area, and the inclusion of a laneway (Antonio Lopes Lane) reinforces this. Potential POIs include Trinity Bellwoods Park, the shops and restaurants along Dundas Street West and Queen Street West, and the residential areas around these streets.
