Confidence: 90%

Reason: The reversal is fairly straightforward, following the opposite directions.  The confidence is slightly lower (compared to the previous example) because some of the turns are described as "slight" or involve very short distances, which could be subject to minor variations depending on the exact walking path taken.  The lack of specific street names for much of the route also reduces certainty. This area appears to be a mix of residential and potentially some commercial areas in Toronto, given the mention of "Soho Street" and "Soho Place," suggesting some degree of urban density.
