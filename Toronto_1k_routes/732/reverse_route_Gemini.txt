Reasoning: This route is in the west end near Runnymede, potentially close to High Park. Mariposa Avenue is a good anchor point, and the 1222-meter stretch provides a strong directional cue. However, the initial short segments and turns without street names make the beginning a bit less clear.  High Park and Bloor West Village are potential nearby landmarks.
