Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be in the Wallace Emerson neighborhood, near Bloor Street West.  The relatively long segments like the 460.0-meter and 350.3-meter stretches suggest navigating along more substantial roads, possibly Dovercourt Road and Dupont Street, given the general area.  The shorter distances and turns imply navigating residential side streets. The lack of specific street names makes absolute certainty difficult, but the distances and turns paint a fairly clear picture of the route, making a confident reversal possible.  I cannot pinpoint specific landmarks based only on these directions and general coordinates.
