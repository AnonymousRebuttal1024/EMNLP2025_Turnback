Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the residential area of Swansea, near Bloor West Village.  Gilmour Avenue and Beresford Avenue are both real streets in that area. The route has a mix of sharp and slight turns, but the overall path seems relatively straightforward to reconstruct in reverse. The starting point appears to be on Gilmour Avenue. I'm fairly confident about the main streets and the general direction, but less certain about some of the slighter turns and potential smaller streets that could be involved.  Landmarks in the vicinity could include residential homes, Rennie Park, or the shops and restaurants along Bloor Street West a few blocks north.
