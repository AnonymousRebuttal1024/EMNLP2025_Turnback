Reasoning: The presence of Baldwin Street is a key clue, placing the route near Kensington Market, a neighborhood known for its winding streets. The long straight stretch after one of the early turns suggests a main thoroughfare, possibly College Street or Dundas Street West. While the numerous turns without street names add some uncertainty, Baldwin Street and the general distances make the reversal reasonably reliable. Potential POIs include the eclectic shops and restaurants of Kensington Market, and possibly Alexandra Park depending on the exact route.
