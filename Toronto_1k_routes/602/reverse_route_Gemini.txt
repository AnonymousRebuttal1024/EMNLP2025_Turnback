Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the Greektown/Riverdale area, starting near Pape station and heading southeast.  The inclusion of Strathmore Boulevard, Lane North Danforth East Caithness, Ben Kerr Lane, Strathcona Avenue, Blake Street, and Kiswick Street provides good anchoring. However,  I made assumptions about sharp/slight turns and keep right/left.  The long uninterrupted stretches combined with short turns likely reflect navigating a mix of main roads (possibly Pape Avenue, Danforth Avenue, or Broadview Avenue) and smaller residential streets. The presence of these streets along with the general direction and turns suggests proximity to Withrow Park and potentially Riverdale Park East. Potential landmarks include the shops and restaurants along Danforth Avenue, as well as residential buildings and some institutional buildings (perhaps schools or community centers).
