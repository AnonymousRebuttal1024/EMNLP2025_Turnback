Confidence: 90%

This route is quite complex and clearly within the Don Valley Brick Works park and surrounding ravine system. The extremely detailed path including "The Brickworks Trail," "Don Valley Brick Works Park Ponds Loop," "Ravine Beltline Trail,"  "Chorley Park Switchbacks," "Chorley-Beltlne Scenic Natural Trail," and "Douglas Drive" makes me highly confident in the location and the general path.  The many turns and short segments suggest navigating the winding paths and trails of the park and the surrounding residential area.  The Don Valley Brick Works itself, the ponds, and the various trails are prominent landmarks.  Even with the detailed instructions, there's always a possibility of slight variations on the ground, especially with trails that might not be clearly marked in all sections.
