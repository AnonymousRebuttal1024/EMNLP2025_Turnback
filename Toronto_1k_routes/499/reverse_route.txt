Explanation: This route reverses the initial journey step-by-step, transforming each instruction to guide back from D to S while maintaining all specified directives within the allowed vocabulary. Given the complexity and number of turns, my confidence is slightly less than absolute, as some landmarks or street alignments could affect navigation accuracy. However, typical geographic landmarks or POIs were not added as the provided steps are primarily focused on street maneuvers.
