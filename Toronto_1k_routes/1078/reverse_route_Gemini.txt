Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: The inclusion of Glenburn Avenue, Bolster Avenue, Nancy Avenue, and Bertha Avenue makes me quite confident in this reversal. This route is in the Upper Beaches, east of the downtown core, near Woodbine Ave. These street names provide excellent reference points, especially Glenburn's longer section. POIs near the route might be businesses along Queen Street East and potentially Woodbine Park further east.
