Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be north of York Mills based on the coordinates and presence of streets like Hillhurst Boulevard, Hillmount Avenue, Danesbury Avenue, and Lilywood Road, which I am moderately familiar with. The long segment on Hillhurst Boulevard provides a good anchor. The "keep right" suggests a slight curve or bend. The other turns likely represent regular intersections. I am quite confident about the overall reversal but slightly less so about the short unnamed segments as they are hard to identify exactly. The Allen Pathway is also a slight uncertainty as it is difficult to judge its entry and exit points. Potential POIs near this route might be the parks in the area, such as Dane Park.
