Confidence: 85%

This route is quite complex, likely in the downtown core near the Moss Park area.  The inclusion of multiple street names (Peaceful Way, Regent Street, Trefann Street, Queen Street East, Power Street, Berkeley Street, and Frederick Street) significantly increases confidence. This area is dense with a mix of residential, commercial, and some institutional buildings.  The many turns and short segments suggest navigating smaller streets.  While the reversal is more complicated due to the numerous steps, the street names provide enough context to reconstruct the route with good accuracy.  Queen Street East is a major landmark in itself.  Other possible nearby landmarks include Moss Park and various businesses along Queen Street.
