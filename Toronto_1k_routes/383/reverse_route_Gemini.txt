Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route appears to go through Riverdale Park and then towards Cabbagetown based on the street names (River Street, Winchester Street). The named paths "River Street Trail" and "Downtown Downhill" likely represent park paths or smaller connecting roads. While the turns within the park might be slightly ambiguous, the main roads (River, Winchester) provide good anchor points.  POIs along this route likely include Riverdale Park East, and some residential buildings along Winchester. I'm fairly confident about the main segments, but slightly less so about the park pathways, hence the 85% confidence.
