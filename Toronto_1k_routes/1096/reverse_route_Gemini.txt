Confidence: 90%

Reasoning:  The street names Fleet Street, Bishop Tutu Boulevard, and Stadium Road, along with the proximity to Exhibition Place (implied by Stadium Road) significantly increases my confidence. The route is clearly in the Exhibition Place area, near the lakeshore west of downtown. The specific street names provide clear anchors for reversal. Potential POIs include  Exhibition Place venues, the Beanfield Centre,  Ontario Place,  and the  Budweiser Stage.
