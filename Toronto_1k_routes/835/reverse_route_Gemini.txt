Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: Caledonia Road serves as a decent landmark.  The turns are relatively few, and "keep right/left" and "slight left" likely indicate staying on the road or minor curves.  This increases confidence in reversal. The "sharp left" might lead onto a smaller street or driveway. POIs depend on the exact location but could include residential buildings, potentially a small business or two, and possibly a parkette given the residential nature of the area. Based on the coordinates, this could be in the west end, possibly near the Junction or Stockyards areas, although it's hard to be certain without street names for cross streets.
