Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: The coordinates suggest a route roughly near Kingston Road and potentially crossing the train tracks just west of Victoria Park Station.  I'm reasonably confident about the general eastward direction to reverse the route, and the initial and final steps seem quite likely. However, without street names in the original instructions, the precise turns within the residential area are harder to reconstruct with high certainty. I have made some educated guesses based on typical road layouts, potentially near Blantyre Ave or Kingswood Rd. Some POIs near the route might be the Queen Street East shops, and depending on the exact path, potentially the Jimmie Simpson Recreation Centre.
