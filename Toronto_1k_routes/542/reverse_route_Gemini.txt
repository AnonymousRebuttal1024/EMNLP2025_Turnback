Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the Corktown area, given the mention of Corktown Common Trail and Front Street East.  Corktown Common is a large park east of the downtown core, near the Don River.  The presence of Front Street, a major east-west artery, and Berkeley Street adds to this certainty. The initial part of the route likely goes through the park, while the later part seems to navigate the surrounding streets. I'm reasonably confident (80%) about the reverse directions, especially the sections involving the park and Front Street. However, the smaller streets and numerous turns towards the end make me less certain without a map. Minor adjustments might be necessary on the ground. POIs along this route would include Corktown Common, the Underpass Park (potentially), and some businesses along Front Street East.
