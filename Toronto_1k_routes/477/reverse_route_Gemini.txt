Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route is significantly longer and more complex, suggesting a trip through a mixed residential/commercial area potentially with some parks given the winding paths.  The presence of named streets like Kenrae Road and Randolph Road provides some anchoring. I'm less confident because of the many turns and the possibility of small, unnamed streets or pathways that I wouldn't be able to infer. This area is likely near Bayview and Eglinton, based on those street names. The initial and final legs being roughly northwest/southeast aligned helps confirm the overall direction.  It's possible I've missed some nuances, particularly with the "keep right/left" instructions which can be ambiguous without a visual map.
