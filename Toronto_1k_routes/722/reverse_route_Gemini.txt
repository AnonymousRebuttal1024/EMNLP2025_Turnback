Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route, likely in the Swansea/High Park area given the presence of Windermere Avenue and Ardagh Street, involves a number of turns on smaller residential streets. While I have a decent mental map of the major streets in this area,  the precise layout of the smaller streets is harder to recall. The presence of named streets increases my confidence, but the complexity of the turns keeps it from being higher.  High Park and the Grenadier Pond are potential landmarks in the vicinity.
