Explanation: This route likely runs through the Little Italy/Kensington Market area.  The starting point near Bathurst and College allows a southward initial direction.  The long stretches suggest major streets like College and Dundas, and the many turns likely involve smaller streets like Augusta or Bellevue.  Knowing Toronto's grid system helps, but the lack of street names makes precise reconstruction difficult. Potential POIs could include Kensington Market, Alexandra Park, or various restaurants along College Street.
