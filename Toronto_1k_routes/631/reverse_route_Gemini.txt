Confidence: 75%

Explanation:  This route seems to start near Queen Street West and Gladstone Avenue in the Parkdale neighborhood, and head generally west, possibly towards Roncesvalles Avenue. The long 688.3-meter segment suggests a major street, possibly Queen St West itself or perhaps Dundas Street West. I'm somewhat confident because of that long stretch, but the lack of many specific street names beyond the starting point makes it harder to be completely sure. Potential POIs near the start could be businesses along Queen West, and the destination appears to be in a more residential area further west.
