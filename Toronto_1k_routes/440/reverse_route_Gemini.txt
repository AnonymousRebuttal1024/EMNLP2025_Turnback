The inclusion of "Bay West Teamway" is helpful, although it doesn't seem to be a regularly named street (likely a private access road or service alley in the Entertainment District, near the CN Tower or Rogers Centre). This area has a mix of large buildings and open spaces. The long, 693.9-meter segment, suggests a major road like Bremner Blvd or Front St W.  There are a lot of turns and shorter segments, likely representing pedestrian walkways or smaller access roads around larger structures.  While "Bay West Teamway" provides a starting point, the many short segments and "keep left/right" instructions introduce uncertainty, as it's difficult to precisely reconstruct these without a visual map.  The CN Tower and Rogers Centre are likely landmarks nearby based on the general location indicated by the coordinates.
