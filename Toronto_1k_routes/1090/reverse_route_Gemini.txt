Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: Oak Park Avenue and Gatwick Avenue provide solid anchors for this route, placing it in the East York neighborhood, likely east of Woodbine Avenue and potentially north of O'Connor Drive based on the coordinates. These street names and relatively short distances give me good confidence in the reversal. POIs might include local shops and parks in the residential area.
