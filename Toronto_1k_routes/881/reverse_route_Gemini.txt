Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route is very complex, covering a considerable distance and involving numerous turns. It seems to start near Liberty Village (based on the coordinates and the mention of King Liberty Bridge) and head towards the Entertainment District/Fashion District.  While I'm familiar with the major streets like Adelaide, Richmond, and King, the many small streets and turns, combined with the "keep right" and "slight" turn instructions make accurately reversing this route challenging from memory. POIs likely include Exhibition Place, the Enercare Centre, and numerous restaurants and shops in Liberty Village and along King Street West.  The route likely passes through a mix of residential and commercial areas.
