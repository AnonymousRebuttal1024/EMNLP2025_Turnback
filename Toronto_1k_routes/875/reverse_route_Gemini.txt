Confidence: 85%

Explanation: The coordinates and street names (Oakcrest, Westlake) suggest a location near Greenwood subway station and potentially residential streets.  I am reasonably familiar with the area. The route seems relatively straightforward, but the "slight left" adds a little uncertainty, hence the slightly lower confidence. Potential POIs in the area include  parks and residential buildings.  Greenwood Park is also likely nearby.
