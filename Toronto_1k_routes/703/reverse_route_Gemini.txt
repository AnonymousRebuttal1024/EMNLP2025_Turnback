Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Moore Park neighbourhood. Wolfrey Avenue provides a solid anchor, and the relatively short distances and turns suggest a residential area.  I'm reasonably confident in the overall reversal, especially with Wolfrey Avenue as a reference. The shorter, unnamed segments are a little less certain in their precise angles, but the overall path is likely accurate.  The ravine and the Moore Park Ravine footpath might be nearby.
