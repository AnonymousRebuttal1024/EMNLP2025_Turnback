Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route seems to follow a mix of streets and trails, including a potentially unpaved section ("Rexleigh Gravel Climb").  Taylor Creek Hydro Corridor suggests proximity to a ravine area.  The many turns and short segments again lower my confidence in precise reversal, and "keep left/right" instructions are ambiguous without local knowledge. Potential POIs could include Main Street businesses, Taylor Creek Park, and residential areas.
