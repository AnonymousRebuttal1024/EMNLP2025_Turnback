Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route involves a lengthy sequence of turns through what appears to be a residential area of Toronto. While I don't recognize all the street names (Napanee Court, Vanauley Walk etc.) with certainty, those I do recognise (Huron Street) are plausible, and the distances are reasonable for a residential area. The reversal is straightforward, following the turns in reverse order.  The high number of turns and less-familiar street names reduce confidence slightly.  POIs would predominantly be residential houses.
