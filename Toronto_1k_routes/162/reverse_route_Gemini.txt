Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route is short and simple, consisting mainly of a long southward leg followed by several short turns.  Reversing the instructions is straightforward. The lack of street names reduces the geographical context, making precise placement within Toronto uncertain, but the directional instructions are clear and easy to invert. The short distances and lack of landmarks are the primary reason for not giving a full 100% confidence.
