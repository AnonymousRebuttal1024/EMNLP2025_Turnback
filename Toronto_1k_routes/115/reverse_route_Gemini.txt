Confidence: 80%

Reason: The route involves a number of smaller streets (Epworth Manse Lane, Yarmouth Road, Palmerston Gardens, Palmerston Avenue, Olive Avenue, Max Hartstone Lane), none of which are particularly well-known to me. While the sequence of turns and distances seems plausible for a residential area in Toronto, the lack of familiarity with these specific streets reduces my confidence.  The reversal is logically consistent, but the uncertainty surrounding the precise arrangement of these smaller streets impacts the confidence level. There is not enough information to confidently name nearby POIs.
