Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the Yorkdale-Glen Park neighbourhood, specifically near the intersection of Allen Road and Sheppard Avenue West. The presence of Rosewell Avenue and Cheritan Avenue, as well as the roundabout, are clear indicators and give me high confidence in the reversed directions.  The area is primarily residential. Potential nearby landmarks might include the Yorkdale Shopping Centre to the south.
