Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route is located in the Fashion District and heads northwest towards the edge of Trinity Bellwoods park, ending on Bellwoods Avenue.  Adelaide Street West is a main east-west artery, and Shank Street is also a known street. The high number of turns and the complex street network in this area, however, lower my confidence in the exact precision of the reversed directions, especially through smaller streets. Landmarks along this route could include the many clothing stores and businesses of the Fashion District, and Trinity Bellwoods park is likely close by at the end of the route.
