Confidence: 70%

This route, likely in the Lakeshore/Exhibition Place area, seems to involve a mix of smaller streets and potentially a larger road given the 393.2-meter segment. The frequent "keep right" instructions suggest potential curves or forks in the road, and the shorter segments indicate a potentially complex route. The lack of street names reduces my confidence somewhat, as does the presence of multiple "keep right" commands that are hard to precisely reverse without a visual map.  The area is likely close to the CNE grounds and/or Ontario Place given the general coordinates.
