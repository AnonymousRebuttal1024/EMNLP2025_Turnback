The inclusion of the street name "St. Germain Avenue" and the relatively simple route make this reversal very straightforward. St. Germain Avenue is a residential street near York University, giving a good sense of location. The long straight segment after the initial turn suggests it's a major road in the area.  The very short segments at the beginning and end likely represent turning off/onto a driveway or smaller connecting street.  I have very high confidence in this reversal due to the clear street name and simple directions.  York University is a major landmark nearby.
