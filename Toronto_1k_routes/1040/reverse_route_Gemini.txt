Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the East York/O'Connor-Parkview neighbourhood of Toronto. The presence of Cassels Park Trail, Burgess Avenue, Brookside Drive, and Lawlor Avenue strongly suggests this area, and these street names are correctly positioned relative to one another, giving me high confidence. The long 991.9m segment might correspond to a stretch along O'Connor Drive, a major east-west artery in that neighbourhood. The "keep left/right" instructions likely indicate curves or navigating around minor intersections. POIs could include Cassels Park, Taylor Creek Park, or the shops and restaurants along O'Connor Drive.
