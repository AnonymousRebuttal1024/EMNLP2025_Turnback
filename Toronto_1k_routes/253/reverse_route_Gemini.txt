Confidence: 90%

Pepler Avenue provides a solid starting point, and the detailed turns, while numerous, paint a clear picture of the route. The "slight right" and "keep left" instructions add some ambiguity, but the overall structure is well-defined.  This route appears to be entirely residential, likely navigating smaller streets and potentially laneways. Given its location near the Don Valley Parkway, potential landmarks might include schools, parks, or local businesses along nearby major streets.
