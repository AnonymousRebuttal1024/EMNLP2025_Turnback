Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route is a relatively straightforward sequence of turns and movements.  While the exact street names are not provided, the distances and directions are plausible for a Toronto street network. Reversing is fairly simple.  The confidence is slightly lowered because the lack of street names makes precise verification of the smaller street segments more difficult. The area is likely residential, so POIs would be residential buildings.
