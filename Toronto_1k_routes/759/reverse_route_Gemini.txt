Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the Corso Italia/Oakwood Village area, using Hope Street, Boon Avenue, Northcliffe Boulevard, and Oakwood Avenue as good landmarks. I'm reasonably familiar with the street grid in this area.  The relatively few turns and the presence of named streets make the reversal fairly straightforward. Potential landmarks or POIs might include Earlscourt Park or the shops and restaurants along St. Clair Avenue West, depending on the exact location.
