This route appears to be in the Liberty Village neighbourhood. The numerous short segments and turns suggest a navigation through the smaller streets and potentially pedestrian walkways within or around the former industrial complex.  I lack specific street names for much of the route, making it hard to be very precise. The beginning and end points are relatively close together, adding to the complexity of accurate reversal within such a dense area. Potential landmarks could include the various condo buildings, shops, and restaurants that characterize Liberty Village.
