Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the Cabbagetown neighborhood, just east of the downtown core.  The presence of Oskenonton Lane and Seaton Street significantly increases my confidence in the accuracy of the route and its reversal. Cabbagetown is a historic residential area known for its Victorian architecture. Potential landmarks near this route could include Riverdale Park East, which is just south of the neighborhood.
