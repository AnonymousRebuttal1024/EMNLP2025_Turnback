Explanation: Navigating through Torontoâ€™s PATH system involves complex layers and their below-ground nature can add difficulty, yet familiar streets like Navy Wharf Court and Mariner Terrace heighten orientation ability. Compounded turns and directional shifts could introduce potential misalignments, though the preservation of PATH-specific tags and typical spatial navigation ensured relative precision in reverse plotting. Landmarks like the Rogers Centre or Ripley's Aquarium may aid in reinforcing accuracy as distinct location anchors in this downtown Toronto sector.
