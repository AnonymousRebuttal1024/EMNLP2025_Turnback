Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be in the Corktown/Regent Park area, just east of the downtown core. The presence of Sackville Street and Ontario Street provides good landmarks, and the coordinates support this location. The numerous turns and varying distances suggest navigating through a mix of main streets and smaller side streets. The "slight left/right" instructions introduce a small degree of uncertainty, but overall, the reversed directions should be quite accurate.  Potential POIs include St. James Park, or businesses along Parliament Street.
