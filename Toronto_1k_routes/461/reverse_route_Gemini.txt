Confidence: 85%

The inclusion of street names "Triller Avenue," "Cowan Avenue," "Milky Way," and "Melbourne Place" significantly helps locate and understand this route. This cluster of streets is located in the Parkdale neighborhood, just north of Queen Street West, an area with a mix of residential and commercial buildings. The multiple "keep left" instructions suggest curves or forks in the roads, which is typical for this part of Toronto. The longer stretch on Milky Way likely represents a more substantial street compared to the others, which seem to be smaller residential roads. While there's a minor ambiguity with "slight left", the named streets allow for a relatively confident reconstruction of the reverse route.  I don't have specific landmarks other than the named streets themselves, but the general location suggests proximity to Queen Street West's businesses and potentially to High Park further north.
