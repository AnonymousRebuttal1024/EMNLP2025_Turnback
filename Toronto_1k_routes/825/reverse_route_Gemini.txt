Confidence: 95%

Reasoning:  This is a very straightforward route with primarily one long straight segment.  This makes reversal easy and highly reliable.  The "keep right" instruction is likely a minor course correction.  The lack of street names makes identifying specific POIs challenging. It seems to primarily be a north-south traversal, possibly along a major road.  It's difficult to say more about the location without additional context, but given the starting coordinates, it could be somewhere east of the Don Valley Parkway, perhaps near the Beaches, based on my vague recollection of Toronto's street layout.
