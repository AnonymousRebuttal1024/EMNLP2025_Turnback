Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the Forest Hill neighborhood, clearly identified by Elm Ridge Drive, Elm Ridge Circle, Old Park Road, and Ridelle Avenue.  The turns suggest navigating residential streets in a relatively affluent area.  The clear street names and the straightforward nature of the route give me high confidence. Potential POIs include large residential properties and potentially the nearby Upper Canada College private school.
