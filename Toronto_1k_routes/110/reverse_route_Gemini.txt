Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route involves a series of turns along what seems like a less-densely populated area of Toronto. The street names (Esandar Drive, Industrial Street, Laird Drive, Stickney Avenue) sound plausible, but I don't have a strong mental map of this specific area of Toronto's street network. The distances are reasonable, and reversing the instructions is straightforward. The slight reduction in confidence stems from the unfamiliar street names and my lack of perfect visualization of their precise arrangement.  There would likely be industrial buildings or light commercial properties in this area.
