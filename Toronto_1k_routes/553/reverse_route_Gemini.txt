Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in a residential area, likely east of the Don Valley Parkway, based on coordinates and the street names Verral Avenue and Colgate Avenue which sound like residential streets in that area.  The mix of longer and shorter segments suggests navigating a combination of main streets and smaller residential roads. "Busy Street" likely refers to a locally significant road, but without a map, it is difficult to confirm. My confidence is around 80% because the sequence of turns and distances appears logical for a residential area, but the lack of a map makes me uncertain about the exact street layout and any potential one-way streets. Possible POIs could include residential homes, a local park, or schools.
