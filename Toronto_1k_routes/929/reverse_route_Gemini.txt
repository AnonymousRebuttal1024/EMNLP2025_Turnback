Confidence: 80%

Reasoning:  This route likely starts near Christie Pits park and heads north towards the area around St Clair West and Bathurst. Shaftesbury Avenue and Shaftesbury Place provide good anchoring points. The long 994.4-meter segment likely represents a major road like Bathurst Street. I'm fairly confident in the main streets and the reversal of directions, but some uncertainty remains regarding smaller streets and the precise placement of Shaftesbury Place.  Landmarks near here would include residential homes, Christie Pits park, and possibly the shops and restaurants along St. Clair West.
