Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the Corktown neighbourhood, starting near the Distillery District (Gristmill Lane) and heading northeast towards Riverdale. Sumach Street is a major road in that direction, and its presence increases my confidence considerably.  The other streets are less certain but the overall trajectory and the anchoring effect of Gristmill Lane and Sumach Street make this reversal highly likely. Potential landmarks include the Distillery District buildings at the starting point and potentially the Riverdale Park area depending how far north the route extends along Sumach.
