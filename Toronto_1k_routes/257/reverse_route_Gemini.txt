Confidence: 90%

The numerous street names (Huron Street, Grange Avenue, Grange Place, D'Arcy Street, La Plante Avenue, Hayter Street) make me quite confident in this reversal. The route is intricate, suggesting navigation through a residential area, likely with a mix of houses and smaller apartment buildings. This area is just west of the University of Toronto, near the Annex neighbourhood. Potential landmarks include the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Ontario College of Art and Design, and various restaurants and shops along Bloor Street West.
