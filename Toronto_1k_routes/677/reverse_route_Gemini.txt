This route seems to be in the Rosedale neighbourhood, ending on Elm Avenue.  The long, straight segments suggest major roads.  I'm fairly certain about the reversal, as the initial "south" and the final "Elm Avenue" provide strong anchors. The mid-route "keep left" instructions are slightly less certain and could refer to slight curves or forks where precise angles are unclear. Rosedale Valley Ravine might be a nearby landmark.
