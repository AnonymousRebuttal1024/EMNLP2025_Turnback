Confidence: 92%

Reasoning: My confidence is 92% because the route includes several named streets (Walder Avenue, Eglinton Avenue East, Cleveland Street, Millwood Road), serving as strong landmarks to guide the reversal process.  The distances are reasonable, and the directions are relatively simple to reverse.  There's some potential for minor error in precisely replicating the shorter segments and the sharpness of turns, but the named streets and longer stretches significantly reduce this uncertainty.  The general area is fairly familiar to me which increases the likelihood of accurate path reversal.
