Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: The inclusion of St. Joseph Street and Breadalbane Street provides good location information, placing the route likely near the University of Toronto and the Annex neighbourhood.  Knowing these streets helps considerably in reconstructing the route, particularly the long stretch after Breadalbane Street. The shorter segments before St. Joseph Street have a bit more uncertainty, but the overall reversal is likely accurate. Potential POIs include the University of Toronto campus buildings, the shops and restaurants along Bloor Street West, and possibly the Royal Ontario Museum.
