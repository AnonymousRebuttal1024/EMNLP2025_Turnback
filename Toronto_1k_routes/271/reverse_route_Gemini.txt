Confidence: 90%

Osborne Avenue and Westlake Avenue, combined with the mention of "GO Train Access," provide solid anchors, boosting my confidence. The detailed turns, while numerous, further clarify the route. "Slight left" and "Keep right/left" add a bit of ambiguity, but the landmarks help mitigate this.  This route seems to be in the Riverdale/Leslieville area, near a GO Train line (likely the Lakeshore East line).  Given the "GO Train Access," a nearby train station is a significant landmark. Other landmarks might include residential buildings and potentially some commercial properties or parkland along the route.
