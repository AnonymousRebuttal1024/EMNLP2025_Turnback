**Confidence: 85%**

**Reason:** The route involves a high number of multidirectional shifts, including sharp turns and intricately managed maneuvers, like the convoluted reentry at Kendal Avenue and Walmer Road intersections. The complexity is recognized and addressed here through single filtered instructions and turns. The explicit names, such as Ulster Street and Major Street, anchor path guidance but introduce localized variability due to overlapping urban junctions, maintaining moderate certainty through sequential logical compliance across diverse, intricate paths.
