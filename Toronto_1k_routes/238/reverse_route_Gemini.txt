Confidence: 95%

This route involves specific landmarks like the Martin Goodman Trail, Remembrance Drive, and the King Liberty Bridge, which greatly increases my confidence.  The Martin Goodman Trail is a popular waterfront path, Remembrance Drive is a nearby road, and the King Liberty Bridge is a prominent overpass.  This area is near the waterfront and likely features parks, recreational areas, and possibly residential or commercial buildings. The sequence of turns is complex, but the landmarks provide strong anchors.
