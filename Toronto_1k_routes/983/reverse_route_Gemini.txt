Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the Leslieville neighborhood, close to Lake Ontario. Lee Avenue is a residential street in that area, and the Martin Goodman Trail is a prominent waterfront pedestrian and cycling path. The presence of the trail and Lee Avenue increases my confidence. The shorter segments and sharp turns likely reflect navigating smaller streets and potentially pathways near the waterfront.  Tommy Thompson Park (formerly Leslie Street Spit) is a potential landmark in the vicinity.
