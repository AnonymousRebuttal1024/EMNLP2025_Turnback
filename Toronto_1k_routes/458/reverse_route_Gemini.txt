Confidence: 95%

The presence of "Dewbourne Avenue," "Chiltern Hill Road," "Strathearn Road," and "Connaught Circle" provides excellent location information.  This route is clearly in the very affluent Bridle Path neighborhood, north of Lawrence Avenue East.  Connaught Circle is a particularly distinctive feature due to its circular shape and large, expensive homes. The long stretch along Chiltern Hill Road indicates a major road in the area. The roundabout at Connaught Circle also adds a clear landmark.  I have very high confidence in the reversal due to the specific street names and distinct features of this area.
