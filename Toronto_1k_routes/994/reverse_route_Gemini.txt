Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the Swansea neighborhood, potentially south of Bloor Street West.  Wyatt Avenue and Nicholas Avenue are residential streets in this area. The presence of those named streets significantly increases my confidence. The "Keep Right" instructions and shorter segments suggest navigating around some features, possibly small parks or curved roadways, typical of Swansea's less rigidly grid-like layout.
