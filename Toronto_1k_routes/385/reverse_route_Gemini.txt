Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the Briar Hill-Belgravia area near Eglinton West subway station and the intersection of Dufferin and Eglinton. The street names (Bowie, Fairbank) are familiar to this area. The multiple turns suggest navigation through a residential neighborhood.  I'm confident about the main streets (Bowie, Fairbank) but the short turns and unnamed segments reduce the overall confidence a little. Potential POIs might include Eglinton West subway station or the shops along Eglinton Avenue West.
