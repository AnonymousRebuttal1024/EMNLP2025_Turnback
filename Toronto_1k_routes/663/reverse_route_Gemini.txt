Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route seems to start near the intersection of Lake Shore Blvd West and Park Lawn Rd in the south Etobicoke area and moves generally south, and then west.  Kinsdale Boulevard, Park Lawn Road, and Keywell Court are good locators in that area.  The 505.1m segment along Kinsdale provides a solid anchor for reversing the directions. I'm fairly confident due to these named streets, but the few short, unnamed segments introduce a slight bit of uncertainty. Humber Bay Park West is likely close by, as are residential buildings along Park Lawn.
