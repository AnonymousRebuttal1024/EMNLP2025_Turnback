Confidence: 60%

Reasoning: This is a long and intricate route that clearly goes through downtown Toronto. Landmarks like Queen Street West, James Street, the Eaton Centre, Gould Street, and Nelson Mandela Walk make parts of it easy to follow.  However, the numerous unnamed turns and the indoor navigation through the Eaton Centre significantly decrease my confidence.  "Keep right/left" instructions inside a mall can be particularly challenging to reverse without knowing the exact layout. The initial and final legs are east/west, consistent with the coordinates.  I'm somewhat confident in the reversed route, but the complexity means there's a decent chance of errors, particularly within the Eaton Centre.
