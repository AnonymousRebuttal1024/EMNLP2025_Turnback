Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: My confidence is 95% because the route uses clearly named streets (Hanna Road, Sharron Drive, Rumsey Road) as landmarks, making the reversal relatively straightforward. The distances are also reasonable. The only potential source of error is the imprecision of "slight right," but the overall sequence of directions and street names allows for a high degree of accuracy in the reversed instructions.
