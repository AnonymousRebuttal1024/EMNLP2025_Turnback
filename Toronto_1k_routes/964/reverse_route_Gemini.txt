Confidence: 80%

This route is also likely in the Junction Triangle, very close to the previous example.  Durie Street and Ardagh Street are again mentioned. The presence of these named streets helps.  There are some very short segments (e.g., 2.1 meters, 4.7 meters, 6.3 meters) suggesting pedestrian shortcuts or slightly off-road paths. But the overall path seems plausible within the grid structure of that area. The area has a mix of residential and industrial uses.
