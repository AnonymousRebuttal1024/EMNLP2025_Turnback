Reasoning: Niagara Street and Gore Vale Avenue are good anchors.  However, the many short segments, "slight" turns, and a "sharp left" create uncertainty in precise reversal. "Keep right" adds further ambiguity. Potential POIs might include residential buildings along these streets, perhaps some small businesses on Niagara Street, and maybe a park given the area is likely in the west end, potentially near the Junction or Parkdale, judging by street names and general Toronto layout knowledge.
