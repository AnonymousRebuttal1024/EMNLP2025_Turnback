Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route seems to be located near the northern part of the High Park neighbourhood, possibly close to the intersection of Bloor Street West and Keele Street/Weston Road.  Allen Pathway is a key landmark that suggests proximity to the ravine system and parkland in that area. The relatively short distances and multiple turns indicate maneuvering through residential streets or park paths.  I'm fairly confident about the reversed route due to the presence of the named path, which acts as a good anchor, but the lack of other named streets and shorter distances introduce a bit of uncertainty. Possible POIs could include High Park itself, the ravine trails, or residential buildings along the edges of the park.
