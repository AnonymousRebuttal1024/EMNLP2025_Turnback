Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the Junction Triangle area west of downtown Toronto, potentially near Dundas Street West and Keele Street based on the coordinates.  The presence of Shirley Street increases my confidence as it is a known street in that area. The route involves a mix of shorter and longer segments, suggesting travel through residential streets and possibly a short stretch on a larger road like Dundas. The "keep right" instruction indicates a slight curve or a minor intersection.  I am fairly confident about the initial southward direction and the reversal of the longer segments, including Shirley Street. However, without other street names and with a few "turn left/right" instructions without distances, there is a possibility of minor inaccuracies in the reversed directions, particularly concerning the shorter segments. Potential POIs near this route might include the shops and restaurants along Dundas West, the Museum of Contemporary Art, or the train tracks that run through the Junction Triangle.
