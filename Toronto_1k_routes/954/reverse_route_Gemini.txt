Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route appears to begin near Pape Station and head generally east towards the Danforth and Coxwell area. Wicksteed Avenue and Clarke Street help anchor the location. The initial long segment (702.4m) likely involves a stretch along Pape Avenue. The numerous turns after this suggest navigation through the residential streets east of Pape. While I'm reasonably confident about the general direction and the segments involving named streets, the several short turns and "slight right" instructions make it hard to be completely accurate without a visual map.  Landmarks might include residential buildings, Pape station at the start, or possibly some shops and restaurants closer to the Danforth.
