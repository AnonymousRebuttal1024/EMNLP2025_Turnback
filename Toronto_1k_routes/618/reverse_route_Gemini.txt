Confidence: 95%

Explanation: The route appears to be within the Trinity Bellwoods neighborhood, starting in Joel Weeks Park and moving north along Munro Street.  The numerous short turns at the beginning suggest navigating a path or small walkway within the park. The long stretch along Munro St provides a strong anchor for the reverse directions.  I'm quite confident given the clear instructions and my general familiarity with the area.  Trinity Bellwoods Park itself is a major POI nearby, along with various restaurants and shops on Queen Street West, which is likely a few blocks east of this route.
