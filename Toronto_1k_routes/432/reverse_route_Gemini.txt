Confidence: 95%

The specific street names (Old Park Road and Connaught Circle) and the roundabout provide strong clues. Connaught Circle is a well-known residential street featuring large, stately homes in the exclusive Bridle Path neighborhood. Old Park Road also runs through this affluent area.  The presence of the roundabout makes the reversal relatively straightforward. The "keep right/left" instructions add a bit of ambiguity regarding precise curvature, but the overall reversal is highly likely to be accurate due to the specific landmarks and road features. I'm very confident in this reversal due to the easily identifiable landmarks and clear road features.
