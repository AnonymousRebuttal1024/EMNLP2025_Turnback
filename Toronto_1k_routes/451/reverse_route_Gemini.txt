Confidence: 90%

The inclusion of "Lacey Avenue," "Cameron Avenue," and "Scott Road" helps place this route in the Islington-City Centre West neighborhood, north of Bloor Street.  This area is primarily residential.  The various turns and distances suggest navigation through a residential area with some potentially winding roads, indicated by the "slight" turns. The presence of named streets greatly aids in reversing the directions accurately.  I'm highly confident due to the street names, though some minor discrepancies could exist due to the "slight" and "sharp" turn instructions without a visual map. There aren't any immediately obvious major landmarks nearby other than the residential streets themselves.
