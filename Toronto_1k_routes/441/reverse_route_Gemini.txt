Confidence: 90%

"Algarve Crescent" gives a very specific location in the Islington-City Centre West neighborhood, just north of Bloor Street West. The many "keep left" instructions suggest navigating curving roads and potentially ramps.  The long, 595.7-meter segment may represent a stretch of Islington Ave.  The shorter distances likely represent turns within residential areas. I am highly confident in the reversal due to the named street and the relatively clear progression of turns, although there might be some small variations on the ground because of the curve nature of Islington Ave.  There are no major landmarks immediately recognizable other than the residential nature of the area. Islington subway station could be within a reasonable distance based on the coordinates.
