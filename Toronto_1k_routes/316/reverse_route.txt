Explanation: This route makes its way through Toronto’s Regent Park or nearby neighborhoods, where dense, interconnected streets like Carfrae Lane and Sumach Street occur within compact urban terrain. Given the area’s structured yet tightly spaced layout, directional cues provide valuable guidance for executing a successful reverse sequence. Although frequent directional changes ask for exactness, Toronto’s established road grid and distinct street orientations effectively support the reverse mapping, yielding a confident navigation pathway.
