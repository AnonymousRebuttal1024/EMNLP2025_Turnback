This route appears to be in the Cabbagetown South neighborhood, east of the downtown core. Ditty Lane is a small street I'm aware of in that area. The numerous short segments and frequent turns suggest a winding path, likely through residential streets.  Cabbagetown is known for its Victorian-era houses and its somewhat labyrinthine street layout, so this route seems plausible. The 529.9-meter segment likely corresponds to a main street like Parliament Street or Sherbourne Street.
