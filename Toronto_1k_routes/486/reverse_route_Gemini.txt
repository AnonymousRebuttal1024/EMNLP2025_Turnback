Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in a residential area with relatively short distances and frequent turns, suggesting smaller blocks. Regent Street, Sutton Avenue, and Peaceful Way are good landmarks for orientation. The initial southward direction and numerous turns imply a generally grid-like layout but with some potential curves or offsets.  This area seems to be close to Annex based on street names. I'm fairly confident, but some of the shorter unnamed segments could be slightly off without a visual map.
