Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in a residential neighborhood, likely east of downtown.  Street names like Gowan, Carlaw, and Westwood, along with Arundel Avenue as the destination, help anchor the route and suggest this is in Leslieville or Riverdale.  The multiple turns and relatively short distances make it somewhat complex. The "sharp" and "slight" turns introduce some ambiguity as their precise angles are unknown. The "keep left" instruction also adds a bit of uncertainty. While the street names give me decent confidence, the numerous turns decrease it somewhat.
