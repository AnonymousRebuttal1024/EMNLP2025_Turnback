Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route is north of York University campus near the Black Creek area. Flemington Road and Varna Drive are recognizable, giving me good anchor points. The other turns seem to be on smaller residential streets. While the initial and final segments are short and unnamed, the longer stretches on Flemington and Varna help with the reversal.  Potential landmarks could include Downsview Park (though a bit further south) and the surrounding residential neighborhoods.
