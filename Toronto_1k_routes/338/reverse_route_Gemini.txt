Confidence: 70%

Explanation: This route seems to be in a suburban area, possibly in Scarborough, given the presence of Engelhart Crescent and a Bank of Montreal drive-thru, which suggests a commercial area nearby.  I'm reasonably confident about the sections along Engelhart Crescent and the drive-thru. The multiple short turns and unnamed roads reduce my certainty, as these could represent parking lot maneuvers, smaller access roads, or pedestrian paths within a commercial plaza.  Potential POIs in this area might include shops, restaurants, and residential homes.
