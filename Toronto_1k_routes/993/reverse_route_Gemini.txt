Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the Fairbank neighborhood, north of Eglinton Avenue West and east of Dufferin Street.  Miranda Avenue, Castlefield Avenue, Ronald Avenue, Caledonia Road, Bowie Avenue, and Croham Road are all residential streets I recognize from that area. This area is largely residential with a mix of housing types. The long segment (353.5 meters) probably represents a stretch along Eglinton Avenue West, or a major north-south street.  I'm reasonably confident about the reverse directions given the presence of these named streets.
