Confidence: 85%

This route is in the Cabbagetown area just east of downtown, based on the coordinates and the street names St. Bartholomew and Sackville. These streets provide good landmarks.  The many short segments and turns suggest navigation through a residential neighborhood, possibly involving laneways or small side streets.  The "keep right" instruction likely indicates a slight curve. I'm fairly confident in the reversal, but the number of short segments makes it a little less certain. Riverdale Farm could be a nearby POI.
