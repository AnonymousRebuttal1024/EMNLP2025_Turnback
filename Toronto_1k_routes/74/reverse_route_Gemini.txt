Confidence: 93%

Reason: The reversal is fairly straightforward, mainly involving opposite turns.  The confidence is slightly reduced because of the "slight left" turn and several short turns that could have minor variations depending on the exact path. The lack of street names also contributes to slightly lower confidence.  The route's length and number of turns suggest a possibly mixed residential and commercial area.
