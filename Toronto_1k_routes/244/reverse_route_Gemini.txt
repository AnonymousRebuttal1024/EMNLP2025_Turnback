Confidence: 80%

This is a long and complex route with many turns. The lack of street names makes it more challenging. The two "continue straight" instructions suggest some form of uninterrupted path or road, but without more context, it's difficult to be certain. The initial and final northwest/southeast directions give me some confidence, but the many turns in between introduce a level of uncertainty. Based on the coordinates, the route is in the western part of the city, potentially near or within Exhibition Place, given the winding nature and length. Potential landmarks could include exhibition buildings, park spaces, or the waterfront.
