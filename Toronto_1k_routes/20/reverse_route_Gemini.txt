Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: My confidence is 90% because this route, while involving many turns, has clearly named streets (Sunnyside Avenue, Fern Avenue, Geoffrey Street) which act as strong landmarks.  This allows for a more accurate reversal of the directions. The distances are also relatively manageable, and the overall route is straightforward to reverse. While there might be minor variations in the real-world path due to street layout inaccuracies in my internal model, the named streets provide high confidence in the reversed instructions.
