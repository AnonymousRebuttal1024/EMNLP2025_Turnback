Confidence: 80%

Reasoning:  This route seems to be in the Yonge and St. Clair area, probably near Cedarvale Park, given the presence of Gledhill Avenue, Cedarvale Avenue, and Sammon Avenue. The mix of shorter and longer segments suggests navigation through a residential area. While the named streets offer some anchor points, the presence of several turns and a couple of "slight left" instructions introduces some uncertainty without a map. Potential POIs might include Cedarvale Park itself and businesses along St. Clair Avenue West.
