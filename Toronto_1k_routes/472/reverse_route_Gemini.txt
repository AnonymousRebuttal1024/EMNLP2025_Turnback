Confidence: 90%

"Distillery Lane" is a very clear indicator, placing this route in the Distillery District, a pedestrian-only village east of downtown known for its Victorian industrial architecture. The multiple "keep left" instructions combined with short distances and sharp turns indicate navigation through this pedestrian zone, which has some winding paths and alleys. The long 910.2-meter segment likely represents a stretch along a major road nearby, possibly Front Street East or Eastern Avenue, before entering the Distillery District itself. I'm highly confident in the reversal due to the strong landmark of Distillery Lane, although the precise turns within the district could have slight variations without visual confirmation. The Distillery District itself, with its numerous shops, restaurants, and art galleries, is the prominent landmark here.
