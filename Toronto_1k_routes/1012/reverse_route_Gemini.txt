Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the Yarrowdale/Mount Pleasant area. The coordinates suggest a location close to Yonge Street and the presence of Kilgour Road and Broadway Avenue, both real streets in that area, significantly increases my confidence.  The route seems to navigate a relatively straightforward path, possibly involving a few residential streets and a main road (likely Broadway Avenue). My knowledge of the general street layout in this area, combined with the confirmation of specific street names, allows for a relatively accurate reversal of directions.  I'm slightly less than 100% confident because of the "Keep right" instructions, which could involve slight curves or unmarked intersections that might be difficult to reverse precisely without visual confirmation.  Possible POIs near this route could include Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Yonge Street shops and restaurants, and the Yarrowdale Ravine.
