Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be located just east of the Don River and south of Danforth Avenue, possibly in the area around Withrow Park, based on the coordinates. The route lacks named streets, but the relatively few turns and short distances suggest a localized area, which increases my confidence in the reversal. The sharp left turn could be a significant corner or intersection, which helps to anchor the reversal. The "slight" turn qualifiers introduce minor ambiguity, but the overall simplicity of the path suggests a high likelihood of accuracy.  Possible POIs could include Withrow Park or businesses along Danforth Avenue.
