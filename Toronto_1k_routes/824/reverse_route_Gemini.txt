Confidence: 90%

Reasoning:  Rajah Street and Ameer Avenue provide clear starting and ending points, and the route involves a relatively small number of turns. The "slight left" instructions suggest minor adjustments on the route.  The area appears to be residential based on the street names.  The specific street names allow for better reversal and higher confidence. Potential POIs could include residential houses and possibly a small local park.  Based on my knowledge of Toronto, this area might be in the northwest, possibly near York University or Downsview, as these areas have streets with names of this style.
