Confidence: 90%

The numerous street names (Leslie Street, Bushell Avenue, Myrtle Avenue, Boultbee Avenue) along with the detailed turn-by-turn instructions significantly bolster my confidence in accurately reversing this route. This area appears predominantly residential, possibly interspersed with smaller commercial establishments, judging by the street layout and the presence of Leslie Street, a more prominent road. This is in the Leslieville/Riverdale area. Noteworthy landmarks could include Jimmie Simpson Park, or businesses along Queen Street East which is nearby.
