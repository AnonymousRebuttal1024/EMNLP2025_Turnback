Confidence: 90%

"Queensdale Avenue" is a key identifier for this route, placing it in the Leslieville neighborhood east of the Don Valley. This area is mainly residential.  The long stretch on Queensdale provides a solid anchor, while the other segments and "keep left/right" instructions suggest navigating smaller streets and possible curves. While the "sharp right" and "slight right" add some ambiguity, the named street and relatively clear progression give me high confidence in the reversal accuracy.  Pape Avenue is a major north-south route likely nearby, and the Don Valley Parkway isn't far off based on the general coordinates.
