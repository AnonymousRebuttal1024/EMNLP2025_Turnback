Confidence: 90%

Explanation:  This route is relatively straightforward and appears to be navigating a residential area likely south of Queen Street East. The turns are clear, and the final leg being a longer straight section suggests Mendelssohn St. might be a bit longer. The coordinates confirm a location near Leslieville/Riverside.  I have decent confidence based on the street layout common in that area and the provided directions. POIs nearby could include Jimmie Simpson Park, or businesses along Queen Street East.
