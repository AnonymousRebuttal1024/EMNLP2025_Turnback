Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route seems to be near the Moss Park area and heads east towards the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood. The mention of Ontario Street and Spruce Street helps place the route. The 504.9m and 531.9m segments likely correspond to major streets, possibly Dundas Street East and Church Street, respectively. The shorter segments likely navigate local streets. I'm reasonably confident, owing to the named streets, but without a visual aid, the several unnamed turns introduce some uncertainty. Potential POIs might include Moss Park near the start, and various businesses and residential buildings towards the east, along Church Street or in the Church and Wellesley Village.
