Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the Cabbagetown area, based on the mention of Boulton Avenue.  I'm reasonably confident about the general direction and the reversal, particularly with the longer stretches on Boulton and the unnamed road. The shorter segments and the initial unnamed road reduce my confidence slightly.  Potential landmarks or POIs near this route could include Riverdale Farm and the Don Valley Parkway.
