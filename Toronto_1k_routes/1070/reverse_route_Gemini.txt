Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: The inclusion of Homewood Avenue and Maribeth Avenue provides strong location information, pinpointing the area to just north of Danforth Avenue, potentially near Pape Avenue. These streets, along with the relatively short distances and specific turns, allow for a highly confident reconstruction of the reverse route. Possible POIs near this area include the shops and restaurants along Danforth Avenue and potentially Withrow Park a bit further east.
