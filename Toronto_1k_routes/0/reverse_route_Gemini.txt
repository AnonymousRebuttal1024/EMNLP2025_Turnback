Confidence: 85%

Reasoning:  This route is in the East York area, near the Don Valley trail system.  I'm familiar with the general layout of streets and the trail in that region, including the existence of streets like Vanderhoof and the presence of the Don Trail.  However, the inclusion of smaller streets like "Swamp" and "Brian Peck Crescent" makes me slightly less certain, as I don't have a precise mental image of their exact locations and turns. I am assuming the provided street names and turn directions in the input are accurate.  The Don River and the surrounding parkland are notable POIs near this route.
