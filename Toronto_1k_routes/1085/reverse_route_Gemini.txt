Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: The coordinates place this near the intersection of The Queensway and Parkside Drive, close to High Park. The long straight segments likely correspond to major roads like The Queensway or Parkside Drive.  While I don't have street names for confirmation, the limited number of turns and the overall distances provide reasonable confidence. Potential landmarks are the southern edge of High Park, the shops and restaurants along The Queensway, and potentially the Grenadier Pond.
