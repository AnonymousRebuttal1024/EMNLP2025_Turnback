Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the King West and Liberty Village areas, traversing a rather convoluted path likely involving smaller residential streets and potentially crossing the train tracks.  The lack of street names makes it quite challenging to reconstruct the many turns accurately. I'm moderately confident about reversing the longer stretches, but the abundance of short segments and turns with slight or sharp modifications makes the exact reversal of those parts uncertain. Potential POIs might include the Exhibition Place grounds further south or the various businesses along King Street West, depending on the precise route taken.
