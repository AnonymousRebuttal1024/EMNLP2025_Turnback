Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route involves a series of turns, with some smaller streets mentioned towards the end. While the major directional changes are clear, the specific layout of the smaller streets (Castle View Avenue, Spadina Road, Baldwin Steps)  and their precise intersections are not completely clear in my mental model of Toronto.  The distances are plausible.  The reversal is logically sound but the lack of complete familiarity with the area leads to a slightly lower confidence level.  The area is likely a mix of residential and potentially some commercial buildings close to Spadina Road.
