Confidence: 90%

This area is likely residential, potentially near the Danforth area given the coordinates.  The short segments and frequent turns suggest a grid-like street pattern with some potential deviations due to things like laneways.  I'm fairly confident in the reversal because it follows a clear path, but there's always a small chance of one-way streets or other minor discrepancies. There are no major landmarks I can place with certainty based solely on coordinates and these short distances.
