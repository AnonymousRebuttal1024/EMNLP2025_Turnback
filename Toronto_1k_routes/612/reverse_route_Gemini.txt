Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be just west of Bathurst Street, likely between College Street and Dundas Street West. The lack of specific street names makes it hard to pinpoint exactly.  The longer "keep left" suggests following a major street, potentially Dundas West. I'm relatively confident in the reversed sequence of turns, though their precise locations are less certain. Potential landmarks could include residential buildings and small businesses along Dundas Street West.
