Confidence: 80%

"Navy Wharf Court" helps locate this route near the waterfront in the Bathurst Quay/Harbourfront area. This area is a mix of residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. The numerous turns and varying distances suggest navigating a network of streets and possibly pedestrian paths near the water. The "slight" turns and "keep left" instruction introduce some ambiguity, but the presence of the named street provides a good anchor.  I'm reasonably confident in the reversal due to the street name, but the route's complexity leaves room for minor discrepancies on the ground without a visual map.  The Harbourfront Centre and the various parks and attractions along the waterfront are potential landmarks in the vicinity.
