Confidence: 75%

This route seems to be in the neighborhood of Fairbank, near Eglinton Avenue West and Dufferin Street.  Gilbert Avenue, Carnarvon Street, Woodborough Avenue, and Castlefield Avenue are residential streets that exist in this area.  The many short segments and turns indicate a winding path through the residential area, and the lack of any long, straight segments makes it difficult to be certain of the exact main roads used.  This reduces my confidence slightly.  This area is mostly residential with a mix of housing styles.
