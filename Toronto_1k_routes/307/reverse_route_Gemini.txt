Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to be near the intersection of O'Connor Drive and Don Mills Road, possibly near the Taylor Creek Park area. While I am not familiar with Gamble Avenue specifically, the sequence of turns and the "keep left" instructions suggest navigating a residential area, potentially with curving streets and some small cul-de-sacs. The lack of other prominent street names makes it harder to pinpoint the exact location and reverse the route with complete accuracy.  Potential POIs might include Taylor Creek Park itself and residential buildings.
