Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the Parkdale/Roncesvalles area, close to Sunnyside and just north of Queen Street West, based on the street names Boustead Avenue, Wright Avenue, and Sunnyside Avenue. The long 921.4-meter segment suggests it may include a portion of Roncesvalles Avenue or a similar main street in the area. The rest likely involves smaller residential streets. My confidence is around 80% because the named streets give me a reasonable anchor for the area, but the numerous short segments and turns make it harder to be entirely accurate without a map, particularly as I cannot be sure of one-way street situations. Possible POIs along this route likely include residential homes, possibly Sunnyside Park, and shops and restaurants along Roncesvalles Avenue.
