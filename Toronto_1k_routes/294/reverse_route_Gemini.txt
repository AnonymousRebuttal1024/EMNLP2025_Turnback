Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is in the affluent Forest Hill neighbourhood, north of St. Clair Avenue West. Mount Pleasant Road is a major north-south road, and the other street names, Forest Glen Crescent, Glen Echo Road, Woburn Avenue, and Jedburgh Road, are all real streets in that area. The turns and distances seem reasonable for navigating the curving, hilly terrain of this neighbourhood. Potential POIs near this route include Upper Canada College and various residential properties. The specific street names and the distinct characteristics of the neighbourhood give me high confidence.
