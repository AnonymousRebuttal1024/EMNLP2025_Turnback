Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is in the Long Branch neighbourhood of Etobicoke, in Toronto's west end.  Queens Avenue, Superior Avenue, Burlington Street, and Skelton Street are all real streets in this area, making the path relatively easy to reconstruct. I'm quite confident in the reversal due to the clear street names and the relatively straightforward sequence of turns. Potential landmarks might include residential homes, Long Branch Public School, or perhaps some businesses along Lake Shore Boulevard West to the north.
