Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: The limited number of turns and the "sharp left" provide a relatively distinct path, making reversal easier.  "Keep right" likely means staying on the main road.  Lack of street names makes pinpointing POIs or the exact location difficult. It appears to be a generally north-south traversal followed by a westward turn. The area is likely residential, potentially near the start point coordinates suggest it might be in Etobicoke or the western part of Toronto, but I can't be certain without more context.
