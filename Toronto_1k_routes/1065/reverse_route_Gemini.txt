Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: The street names Crown Hill Place and Neighbourhood Lane clearly indicate a location in the Stonegate-Queensway neighborhood, south of Bloor Street West. This significantly increases my confidence in reversing the route. The initial short westward segment and the turns along Crown Hill Place are easy to retrace with the street name provided.  Potential POIs nearby might include the shops along Bloor Street West or the Humber River recreational trail further south.
