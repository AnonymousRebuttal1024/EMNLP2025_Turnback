Confidence: 75%

Reasoning:  This route likely weaves through residential streets, probably west of downtown. Portland Street, Carr Street Court, Denison Avenue, Kensington Place, and Kensington Avenue are all helpful landmarks and suggest the Kensington Market neighborhood. The numerous turns, and especially the shorter segments, increase the chance of errors in the reverse directions.  I'm reasonably confident about the main streets, but less certain about the shorter, unnamed connecting sections.
