Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: The multiple "keep left" instructions suggest navigating along a main road with occasional forks or curves.  The route appears to involve a significant loop or detour judging by the lengths of certain segments. The lack of street names makes precise pinpointing difficult, but the coordinates suggest a location possibly near the Don Valley Parkway or the areas east of it, based on my general knowledge of Toronto's layout. Potential POIs could include residential areas, parks along the Don River (if the route is near it), or some commercial establishments depending on the specific streets involved.  The absence of specific landmarks reduces my confidence slightly.
