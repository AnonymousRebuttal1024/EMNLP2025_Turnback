Explanation: The provided coordinates suggest a route in the Annex neighbourhood, likely involving Bloor Street. I've constructed a plausible reverse route incorporating typical street layouts in that area.  However, without street names in the original instructions, the exact path remains uncertain.  The numerous turns suggest some smaller side streets might be involved, which are harder to predict accurately without more context. Potential POIs near this route could include Christie Pits Park or shops and restaurants along Bloor Street.
