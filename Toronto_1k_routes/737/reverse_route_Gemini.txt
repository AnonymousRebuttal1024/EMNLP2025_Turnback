Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Rosedale/Moore Park area, with the presence of Scarth Road providing a good landmark. The numerous short, unnamed segments and turns, however, make precise reversal challenging from a mental map. The long curves ("keep right") suggest the route may be following paths or roads within a park or ravine, perhaps near the Don Valley.  This area has some less regular street layouts, making it tricky. Potential landmarks might include the Rosedale ravine system or the Moore Park Ravine.
