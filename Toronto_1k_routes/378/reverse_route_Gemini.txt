Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the Wilson Heights neighbourhood of North York, near the intersection of Bathurst Street and Sheppard Avenue West. Cheritan Avenue and Cortland Avenue are good indicators.  The relatively short distances and multiple turns suggest navigating residential streets.  I'm fairly confident about the route along the named streets, but the shorter unnamed segments introduce some uncertainty. Potential POIs include residential homes and possibly a local park or school.
