This route appears to be in the High Park-Swansea neighbourhood, possibly near the Grenadier Pond area within High Park. The presence of Indian Road gives me a strong anchor point. The shorter distances and several turns suggest a route within a residential area or potentially along park pathways. I'm reasonably confident about the reversal, especially the section around Indian Road. The lack of other street names makes the other turns a bit less certain, though the overall reconstruction is likely close. High Park and Grenadier Pond are potential landmarks.
