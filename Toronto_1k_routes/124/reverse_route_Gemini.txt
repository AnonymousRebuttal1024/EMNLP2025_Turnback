Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route is a relatively simple sequence of turns, mostly along Sumach Street, a major street in Toronto.  The distances are reasonable. Reversing is straightforward.  My confidence is high because the instructions involve only a few directional changes and the distances are easily estimated based on my understanding of Toronto's street grid.  The area near Sumach Street is a mix of residential and commercial buildings.  The less familiar street names (Goatsbeard Lane, Amelia Street, Rawlings Avenue) don't significantly impact confidence because the route largely follows the well-known Sumach Street.
