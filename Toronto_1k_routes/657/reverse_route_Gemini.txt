Explanation: This route is in the Runnymede neighbourhood, starting on Ardagh St and going east towards Runnymede Rd.  Ardagh, Runnymede, and Woodside are clear landmarks, making the reversal fairly straightforward. The long segment on Ardagh is a good anchor point.  Potential POIs might include Runnymede Public School or the shops and restaurants along Bloor Street West, which is a few blocks north of this route.
