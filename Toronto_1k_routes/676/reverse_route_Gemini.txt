Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the Moore Park neighbourhood, potentially near the ravine. Ravina Crescent provides a good starting point, and the relatively few turns suggest larger blocks typical of this area.  I'm confident in the reversed directions, especially the initial and final legs. The ravine itself would likely be a visible landmark.
