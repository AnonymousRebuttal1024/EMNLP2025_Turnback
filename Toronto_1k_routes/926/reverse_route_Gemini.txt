Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route is in the Yonge and Eglinton (midtown) area, north of downtown Toronto. I'm very familiar with the general area and the street names provided - Castlefield, Duplex, Glengrove, Ansley, and Glenview - all exist there and help confirm the route.  Duplex is a major north-south artery in that area, and the 732.3m distance along it reinforces this.  I'm quite confident in the reversal, but some uncertainty remains due to potential smaller lanes or alleys and the "slight right" turn, which is hard to pinpoint exactly without a visual reference. Potential landmarks in this area might include residential buildings, shops and restaurants along Yonge Street a few blocks east, and possibly Eglinton Park slightly further south.
