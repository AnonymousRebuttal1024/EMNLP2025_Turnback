Confidence: 90%

The inclusion of Pritchard Avenue, Royal Street, and Henrietta Street significantly increases my confidence in the reversed directions. This area appears to be residential, possibly with a mix of housing types, based on the turns and the street names. This is near the western edge of Toronto, in the area sometimes called the "Weston" or "Mount Dennis" neighbourhoods. Potential landmarks might include the shops and services along Weston Road, or perhaps a nearby park or community center.
