Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: Glengrove Avenue East provides a good landmark.  The route is relatively straightforward with a few turns and several "keep right" instructions suggesting following the main road. The starting point is likely in the north York area due to the coordinates and long roads, increasing confidence.  Potential POIs could include residential buildings along Glengrove and other nearby streets. However, the lack of further street names lowers confidence somewhat.
