Confidence: 95%

Haverson Boulevard, Donald Avenue, and Silverthorn Avenue provide strong anchors, making me quite confident in the reversed directions. This area is residential in the west end, near the Junction Area. Potential landmarks include the nearby shops and restaurants on Dundas Street West or the residential streets of the neighborhood.
