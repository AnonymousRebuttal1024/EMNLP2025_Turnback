Confidence: 75%

Explanation:  This route appears to be in the Forest Hill neighbourhood, a residential area northwest of downtown. Austin Crescent and Austin Terrace are good landmarks, but the many turns and short segments, along with several "Keep left/right" instructions, make it tricky to trace mentally without a map.  I am moderately confident; the named streets help, but the complexity of the route decreases my certainty. It's hard to pinpoint specific POIs without more context, but they'd likely be residential buildings, and possibly a local park or school.
