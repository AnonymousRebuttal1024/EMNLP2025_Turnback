**Confidence: 88%**

**Reason:** The route contains a fair number of simpler and complex turns, including keeping left/right and slight right/left adjustments. The path is well-defined with reversals that are clear, yet urban settings like Alton Avenue can introduce slight complications with local paths, crossings, or variations in street width and appearance. However, named streets and clearly defined segments reinforce logical reversal, maintaining a high but not perfect confidence.
