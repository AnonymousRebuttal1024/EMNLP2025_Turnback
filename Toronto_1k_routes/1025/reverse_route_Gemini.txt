Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in East York, likely near Monarch Park, given the presence of Ashdale Avenue, Hiawatha Road, Walpole Avenue, Woodfield Road, Monarch Park Crossing, Felstead Avenue and Lamb Avenue. These are all real streets in that neighbourhood, and their sequence makes sense geographically. The detailed turns and shorter distances suggest navigation through residential streets. The "Keep left/Continue straight" portions likely involve slight curves or following a main road like Monarch Park Avenue.  Potential POIs along this route might include Monarch Park itself, the Danforth GO station, or the shops and restaurants along Danforth Avenue.  My confidence is high due to the specificity of the street names.
