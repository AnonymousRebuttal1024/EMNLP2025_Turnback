Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be downtown, utilizing the PATH system.  The PATH is a network of underground pedestrian walkways in Toronto's financial district.  My confidence is high (90%) because the short distances and mention of "PATH" strongly suggest this environment.  The turns within the PATH can be a little confusing, but the overall reversal is fairly straightforward given the linear nature of the system. I'd expect these directions to be reasonably accurate, though minor adjustments might be needed depending on specific PATH entrances/exits.  Likely POIs near this route would include office towers, shopping malls (Eaton Centre), and subway stations.
