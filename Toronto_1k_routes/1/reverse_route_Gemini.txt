Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route seems to be near the Humber River in the west end of Toronto.  The mention of "Humber River Trail" reinforces this. I am generally familiar with the area and the existence of the trail, but without more specific street names, it's hard to be absolutely certain of the layout of smaller residential streets. I'm confident in reversing the general direction based on the turns, but precise turns are less certain given the lack of detailed street information. The Humber River and its associated parks are notable POIs near this route.
