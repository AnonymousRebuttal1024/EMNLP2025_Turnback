Confidence: 85%

"Monastery Lane" provides a good starting point, placing the route near the intersection of Danforth Avenue and Woodbine Avenue in the east end, in an area that is generally residential. The long, 739.1-meter segment likely represents a major road like Danforth Avenue or Woodbine Avenue.  The other segments and "keep left/right" instructions suggest navigating smaller residential streets and possible curves.  The reversal has a high degree of confidence due to the named street, although the multiple shorter segments and turns at the beginning add a little uncertainty without visual confirmation. I am not aware of significant landmarks solely based on this route information.
