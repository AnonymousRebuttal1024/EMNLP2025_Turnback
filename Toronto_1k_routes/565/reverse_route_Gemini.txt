Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the Liberty Village area or just north of it based on the coordinates and the mention of Maynard Avenue.  The multiple "keep left" instructions suggest a road with curves or a series of gentle bends, potentially near the Exhibition grounds or railway lines. The longer segments indicate the use of larger roads. My confidence is around 80%.  While the overall direction and turns seem reasonable for this industrial-residential area, without access to a map, I am uncertain about the presence of one-way streets or smaller roads that could affect the optimal reverse route. POIs might include residential buildings in Liberty Village, businesses and industrial buildings near the railway lines, and potentially some of the Exhibition Place venues.
