Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Lawrence Park neighbourhood, likely near the intersection of Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue. The street names St. Edmunds Drive and Lympstone Avenue, combined with Glengrove Avenue East, provide good anchors for locating the route. The relatively long stretches on unnamed streets suggest they might be arterial or collector roads. I'm reasonably confident about the reversal, especially with the named streets. The shorter segments and turns are a little less certain, as I don't have precise street names to verify them.  Potential nearby landmarks could include the Lawrence subway station or Alexander Muir/Memorial Park.
