Confidence: 98%

Reason: The route is a simple linear progression along Augusta Avenue, a major street in Toronto, with a few short turns onto smaller streets.  The street names are familiar, and the distances are reasonable. The reversal is extremely straightforward.  The area is likely a mix of residential and commercial properties near Dundas Street West, a major thoroughfare.  My high confidence stems from the clarity of the instructions and my familiarity with the area.
