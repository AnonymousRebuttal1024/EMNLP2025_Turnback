Confidence: 90%

Explanation: The route primarily involves straight paths through feasible directions typical of northern Toronto regions, likely around Allen Road or nearby thoroughfares. Street types and directional cues maintain idealized locational patterns for both residential and actual street arenas. Given such standardized roadway use and typical transport arcs, the directional reversal engages structural dynamics visible in urban areas, supporting confident spatial coordination throughout the path restoration.
