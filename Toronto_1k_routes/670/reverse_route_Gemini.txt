Confidence: 95%

This route seems to be near Yorkdale Shopping Centre, given the presence of Yorkdale Road.  The relatively straightforward path and short distances suggest it's within the mall's vicinity or in the surrounding commercial area.  The presence of Yorkdale Road makes me very confident in the reversal.  Yorkdale Mall itself is a prominent landmark.
