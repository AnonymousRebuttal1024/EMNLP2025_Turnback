Explanation: The instructions were reversed, ensuring directional nuances with matching entry and exit points along Wynford Drive and Eglinton Avenue East, which likely indicates proximity near mid-town Toronto shopping complexes and office spaces in the Flemingdon Park neighborhood. The series of sharp turns and rights was accounted for carefully to mirror the unique layout of possibly semi-commercial sections. This structured retracing bolstered confidence in accuracy of directions without active map referencing.
