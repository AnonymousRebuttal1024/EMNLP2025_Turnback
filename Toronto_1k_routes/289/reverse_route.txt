Explanation: The route navigates through what is presumably East York or a neighboring district oriented towards Torontoâ€™s east end, where streets manifest a balanced residential grid layout featuring short and long segments. Consistency is gained from clearly defined main routes, although additional care might be required to track slight left-right shifts, typical in interconnected local roadways. Such urban planning predictability within neighborhoods supports confident reversal efforts amidst consistent street orientations and methodical distances.
