Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in East York, potentially near the Danforth and Woodbine intersection. The street name Goodwood Park Court provides a decent anchor point. The other short segments likely involve navigating residential streets.  I'm reasonably confident, but the several unnamed segments and lack of other clear landmarks decrease my certainty.  The presence of Goodwood Park Court helps, but I'd need more information to be fully confident about all the turns.
