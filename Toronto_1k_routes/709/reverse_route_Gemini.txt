Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the Garden District neighbourhood, starting near the intersection of Richmond and Spadina and ending closer to Jarvis Street.  The presence of Sirman Lane, Mutual Street, Alexander Street, and Alexander Place helps significantly. The many short segments and turns in the first half suggest navigation through the smaller streets of the area before hitting the larger arteries like Mutual Street and then heading east.  I'm reasonably confident, especially for the latter half of the route with the street names. The many short, unnamed segments in the beginning make that part less certain.  Potential landmarks might include Massey Hall, the Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres, and various restaurants and bars in the Entertainment District.
