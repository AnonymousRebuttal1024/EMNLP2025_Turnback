This route appears to be in the Forest Hill South/Casa Loma area. Rowanwood Avenue and Cluny Drive are residential streets I recognize from that neighborhood, and Chestnut Park likely refers to a smaller street or a part of the park itself. The long straight segment of 1092.4 meters likely follows Spadina Road, a major artery. The inclusion of "Keep right/left" instructions suggests some potentially complex intersections or pathway choices within the park. The many short segments likely reflect pedestrian paths and walkways. Casa Loma, a prominent landmark and tourist attraction, is likely nearby.
