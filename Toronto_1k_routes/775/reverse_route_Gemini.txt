Confidence: 70%

This is a highly complex route with many turns, particularly in what sounds like a residential area, possibly near Trinity Bellwoods given the street names and coordinates. Recognizing Barton Avenue, Silver Bar Lane, John McIntosh Lane, Manning Avenue, and Follis Avenue significantly increases my confidence, as these are specific landmarks. However, the many short, unnamed segments make the exact path harder to visualize and reverse.  There's a good chance some of the "keep right/left" and "slight turn" instructions could be slightly off in the reverse direction.  Trinity Bellwoods Park is a likely POI near this route.
