Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route starts near Christie Pits and generally heads north towards the Annex neighbourhood. Clinton Place is a good starting point reference.  The high number of turns, including "slight" turns and "keep left" instructions, makes precise reconstruction a bit tricky, particularly as the route seems to wind through smaller residential streets.  Landmarks might include residential homes, Christie Pits park to the south, and possibly the University of Toronto's campus to the east if the route extends that far north.
