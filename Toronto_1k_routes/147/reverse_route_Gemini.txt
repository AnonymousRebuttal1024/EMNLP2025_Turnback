Confidence: 88%

Reason: The route is moderately complex with a number of turns and the inclusion of "Dockside Drive".  Reversing it requires careful attention to detail. While the street name provides some geographical grounding, the numerous turns, particularly the slight turns, and the lack of other landmarks introduce some uncertainty. The numerous short segments increase the chances of minor discrepancies between the original and reversed route.  The area might be a waterfront or industrial area, given the name "Dockside Drive",  but I don't have a precise location in mind for this.
