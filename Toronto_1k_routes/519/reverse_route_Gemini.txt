Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route likely goes through a residential area in North York, perhaps near or in Leaside based on Wicksteed Avenue.  The long 677.6-meter segment suggests a main road or a long, straight street.  The "sharp right" onto Wicksteed provides a good anchor, and the overall east-to-west movement is consistent with the coordinate changes. The "slight" turns and the "keep right" introduce some uncertainty. I'm fairly confident, but the absence of other named streets and the potentially ambiguous turns reduce the certainty.
