Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: Porretta Lane, Major Street, and Ulster Street give good landmarks, raising my confidence.  The "keep left/right" suggest navigating main roads or slight bends. The many short turns and changes in direction could make precise backtracking slightly challenging without visuals, hence not full confidence. Potential POIs: Likely residential buildings along these streets, potentially small businesses on Major Street, maybe a school or park depending on the area.  It appears to be in the west end, potentially near the Junction or High Park area, based on my impression of Toronto's street layout.
