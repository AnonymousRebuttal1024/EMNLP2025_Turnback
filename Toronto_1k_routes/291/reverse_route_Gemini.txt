Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is likely near Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, along the waterfront.  The Martin Goodman Trail is a prominent pedestrian and cycling path, and Tom Longboat Lane, Hahn Place, and Scadding Avenue exist in this area. The presence of the trail and the relatively short distances, along with the specific street names, makes me fairly confident in the reverse route. Potential POIs include the airport ferry terminal, the waterfront itself, and possibly some parkland.  The detailed street names help to improve the confidence level.
