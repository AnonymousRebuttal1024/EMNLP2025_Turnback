Confidence: 75%

This route seems to be in the Beaches neighbourhood, potentially near Queen Street East and Woodbine Avenue, based on the street names like Swanwick, Kingswood, and Osborne. These are characteristic of the residential streets in that area. I have moderate confidence (75%) in the reversed directions.  The sequence of streets seems plausible, but without a map, I cannot be completely sure, especially with the "slight" turns which are harder to precisely reverse.  Potential POIs near this route include residential homes, local shops along Queen Street East, and possibly a nearby park or ravine leading down to Lake Ontario.
