Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to navigate the Annex neighbourhood, which has a more irregular street pattern than the previous example.  While streets like Howland, Barton, and Manning exist in this area, the inclusion of smaller lanes like Tandy Murch and Silver Bar Lane, along with numerous short turns, makes it challenging to reconstruct the reverse route with absolute certainty without a map. The frequent turns suggest a possibly meandering path.  Potential POIs near this route could include Christie Pits Park and various residential buildings in the Annex.
