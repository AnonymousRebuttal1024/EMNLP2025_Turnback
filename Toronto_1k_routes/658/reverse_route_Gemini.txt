Explanation: This route seems to start near the intersection of  Coxwell Ave and Gerrard St East. Westlake Avenue helps establish the initial location. The long 718m segment suggests a significant stretch along a major road like Greenwood Avenue or perhaps Coxwell Avenue itself.  The lack of other named streets adds some uncertainty, but the relatively simple sequence of turns makes the reversal reasonably straightforward. Possible POIs include residential buildings, perhaps a small park in the area, and businesses along Gerrard or Danforth, which is likely a few blocks south.
