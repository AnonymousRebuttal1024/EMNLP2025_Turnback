Confidence: 80%

This route is likely in the Don Valley area near the Edwards Gardens and the Toronto Botanical Garden, based on the street names (Ferrand Drive, Wilket Creek Road) and the coordinates.  The many turns and varying distances suggest a mix of roadways and potentially some paths within the park.  The "keep left/right" instructions are a little ambiguous. The presence of named streets increases confidence significantly, allowing for a fairly accurate reversal, although the complexity of the route leaves room for minor errors without visual confirmation.  Edwards Gardens and the nearby Toronto Botanical Gardens are the major landmarks in this area.
