Reasoning: This route seems to start near the intersection of Yonge Street and Davisville Avenue, heading south on Forman Avenue. The long stretches along unnamed roads likely represent segments of major roads like Mount Pleasant Road or Bayview Avenue.  The final right turn onto Rumsey Road positions the destination just east of Yonge Street.  The simplicity of the route, despite the lack of some street names, contributes to higher confidence. Potential POIs might include the shops and restaurants along Yonge Street, the Davisville subway station, and residential buildings.
