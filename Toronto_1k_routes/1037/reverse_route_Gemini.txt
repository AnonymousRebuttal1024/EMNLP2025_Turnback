Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the Corso Italia neighborhood, west of downtown Toronto, near St. Clair Avenue West.  The inclusion of Harvie Avenue makes me quite confident about the route's general location.  The long stretches along Harvie Avenue, coupled with the other shorter segments, suggest navigating residential streets and possibly connecting to a larger road like St. Clair West or Dufferin Street.  The "continue straight" instruction likely represents a continuation on Harvie after a minor intersection. Potential POIs could include the shops and restaurants along St. Clair West, Earlscourt Park, or the residential areas around Harvie Avenue.
