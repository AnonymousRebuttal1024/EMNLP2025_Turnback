Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route seems to be primarily residential, with Gabian Way and Kane Avenue as key landmarks.  The multiple turns and shorter segments indicate navigating smaller streets, perhaps close to a park or green space.  I'm reasonably sure about the longer segments, but "keep left/right" introduces some uncertainty. This area is probably west of downtown near High Park given Kane avenue. The starting and ending coordinates suggest a primarily north-south movement.
