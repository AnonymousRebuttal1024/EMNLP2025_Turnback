Confidence: 80%

This route is likely in the Entertainment District/CityPlace area, close to the waterfront, given the coordinates. The mixture of short and medium-length segments suggests a mix of smaller streets and possibly a larger road. The "slight" turns and "keep left" add a bit of uncertainty, making it challenging to precisely reconstruct the reverse path without a visual aid.  While there are no specific street names mentioned, the general area and types of turns suggest a fairly standard urban grid pattern. I'm reasonably confident in the reversal, but some minor adjustments might be necessary on the ground due to the lack of street names and presence of several "slight" turns. The CN Tower and Rogers Centre are potential landmarks nearby.
