Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the Forest Hill neighborhood, starting near the intersection of Spadina Road and Lonsdale Road.  Ormsby Crescent and Forest Hill Road are strong identifying markers.  The long straight segment suggests following a major road, likely Spadina Road itself. The "sharp" turns indicate more significant direction changes, perhaps onto smaller residential streets. Potential POIs might include large residential properties, the nearby Forest Hill Village shopping area, and possibly Upper Canada College.  I've slightly reduced the confidence because a couple of turns are without street names, making the precise path slightly ambiguous.
