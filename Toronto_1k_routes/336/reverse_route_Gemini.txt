Confidence: 65%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the Yorkdale area, north of Highway 401, likely involving residential streets and potentially some access roads related to Yorkdale Shopping Centre. The presence of Yorkdale Road and Wilson Avenue are good anchors. However, the many short turns and unnamed segments decrease my certainty, as these could represent smaller service roads, parking lot entrances, or pedestrian pathways, which are hard to precisely retrace without a map. Potential POIs nearby include Yorkdale Shopping Centre, Downsview Park (to the east), and potentially some industrial or commercial properties.
