Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route involves a mix of turns and longer stretches, primarily along Old Stock Yards Road and West Toronto Street which are recognizable streets in Toronto. The distances are reasonable, and the reversal is straightforward. The slight reduction in confidence is due to some less prominent turns and distances provided.  The area is likely industrial/commercial around Old Stock Yards Road and potentially residential near the endpoint.  The use of named streets increases confidence.
