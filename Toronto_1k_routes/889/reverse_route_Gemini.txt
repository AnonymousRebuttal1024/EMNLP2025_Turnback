Confidence: 60%

Explanation: This route in the west end, likely near Dufferin Mall and Dufferin Grove Park based on street names (Dufferin, Gladstone, Brockton, Lansdowne) and the coordinates, goes through a highly complex path with many turns.  I'm familiar with Dufferin Street and some of the other main roads, but navigating the maze of residential streets and crescents involved here, with many short segments and turns including "slight" and "sharp" modifiers, makes it difficult to reverse confidently from memory alone.  The sheer number of steps makes keeping track of the reversal process prone to error. POIs might include Dufferin Mall, Dufferin Grove Park, and residential buildings.
