Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the Entertainment District/King West area. The relatively few instructions and longer distances suggest it primarily uses major roads, likely King Street West or a parallel street. I have high confidence in the reversed directions because of the simplicity of the route. Potential landmarks might include theatres, restaurants, or nightclubs in the Entertainment District.
