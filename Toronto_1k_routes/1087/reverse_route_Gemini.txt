Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: The inclusion of Spadina Road and Baldwin Steps gives a good anchor.  Baldwin Steps are a known feature in the Casa Loma area, just west of Spadina Road and north of Dupont Street. Knowing this landmark helps significantly in reconstructing the route. While a couple of turns are not on named streets, the steps themselves and the overall distances make the reversal quite reliable. Potential POIs are Casa Loma itself, and the surrounding residential neighborhood of the same name.
