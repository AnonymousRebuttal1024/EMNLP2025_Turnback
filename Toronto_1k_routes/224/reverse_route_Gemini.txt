Confidence: 98%

Reason:The route is relatively straightforward, with a clear sequence of turns and distances.  The reversal is easily done. While some instructions involve 'keep right/left,' the overall direction is easy to follow.  There are no specific street names to aid in landmark identification, which slightly reduces confidence. The area is likely residential.
