Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the Runnymede/Bloor West Village area. Lincoln Avenue, Runnymede Road, and Gilmour Avenue are all present in this neighbourhood. However, the numerous turns, "keep left/right" instructions, and "slight left/right" instructions, combined with a lack of other major street names, make precise reversal without a map challenging. Potential POIs might include Runnymede Public School and the shops and restaurants along Bloor West Village.
