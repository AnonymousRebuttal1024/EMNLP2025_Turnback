Confidence: 95%

This route is relatively simple with few turns and clear instructions.  This suggests a fairly regular street grid, possibly in a residential area. My high confidence (95%) comes from the simplicity of the route; reversing it is very straightforward. However, as always, without a map I can't be 100% sure about minor details like one-way streets which could necessitate small detours. This route is likely east of the Don Valley Parkway, based on the coordinates. Without more information, it's hard to pinpoint specific POIs, but they would likely include residential homes, possibly a small park or school.
