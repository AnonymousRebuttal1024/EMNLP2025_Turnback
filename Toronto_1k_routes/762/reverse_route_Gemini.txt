Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the North York area, possibly near the intersection of Victoria Park Avenue and Sheppard Avenue East. Craigton Drive is a recognizable street name in that area. The turns are relatively simple, but the lack of other street names makes me slightly less certain. Potential landmarks might include the Fairview Mall or the Don Valley ravine system, depending on the exact location.
