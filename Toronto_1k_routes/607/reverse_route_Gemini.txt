Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Annex neighborhood, west of Spadina Avenue and likely near the University of Toronto. The presence of Walmer Road anchors the location. The many turns and relatively short distances suggest a dense network of residential streets.  I'm reasonably confident in the reversal, especially given Walmer Road, but the numerous unnamed turns and the "sharp left/right" and "slight right" interpretations introduce some degree of uncertainty.  I've generally assumed gentler turns for "sharp" instructions in the reverse. Potential landmarks might include the University of Toronto campus buildings, the shops and restaurants along Bloor Street West, and the residential buildings that characterize the Annex.
