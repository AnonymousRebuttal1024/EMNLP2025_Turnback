Explanation: The route navigates along established streets in the midtown or northern sections of Toronto. The clear sequence between major streets and graciously curved intersections supports effective reversal, sustained by organized north-to-south pathways indicative of these city zones. This structural predictability underpins the backtracking reliability, accentuated by landmark proximities and long stretches that form definitive directional beacons within the urban framework.
