Confidence: 85%

Explanation: The directional inversion carefully respects street names such as King's College Circle and Hart House Circle, illustrating routing through the University of Toronto's St. George campus area. The sequence's structural complexity, comprised of tight turns and continuous segments within this prominent academic hub, mirrors traffic flow within a robust urban grid pattern. The consequential assurance lies in the methodical inversion of logical turns and navigations observed along primary university pathways, hence the moderate-to-high confidence level in accurately reversing the initial path.
