Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: Several street names (Glen Oak Drive, Glen Davis Crescent, Glenmount Park Road, Brookside Drive, Rod Armstrong Lane) provide good landmarks, making the reversal fairly reliable. The "keep left/right" instructions introduce some minor ambiguity, but the overall route seems clear enough.  Potential POIs would likely include residential houses along the named streets, possibly Glenmount Park itself, and perhaps a school or community center. I'm quite confident about the beginning and end of the route due to the specific street names; the middle section has slightly lower confidence because of the turns and shorter segments.  Based on my knowledge of Toronto, this area is probably in the east end, potentially near the Don Valley, as the street names suggest a residential area with some parkland nearby.
