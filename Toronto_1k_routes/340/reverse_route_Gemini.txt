Explanation: While this route is shorter and has fewer turns, the lack of street names makes it a little more difficult.  The coordinates suggest a generally north-south movement, likely in Scarborough. The "sharp right" and "keep left" indicate some non-standard intersections or curves. I'm assuming a relatively straightforward path, but without street names or more context, it's hard to be entirely certain about the exact locations of the turns.  There's a good chance this area is residential, potentially close to a major road or a park given the longer straight segment.
