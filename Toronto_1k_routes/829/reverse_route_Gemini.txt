Confidence: 80%

Reasoning:  The "keep left/right" instructions introduce some uncertainty as they could represent slight curves or forks in the road. "Sharp right" suggests a more significant turn, potentially onto a smaller street. The lack of specific street names makes it difficult to pinpoint landmarks or POIs, which lowers my confidence somewhat.  The general direction seems to be north-south, and based on the coordinates, the location could be in the west end of Toronto, possibly near Etobicoke or the Queensway, although it's hard to say for certain without more context. Potential POIs could include residential buildings, possibly a park or school, depending on the actual route.
