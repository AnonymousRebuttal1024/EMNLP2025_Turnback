Confidence: 70%

Reasoning:  This route likely goes through a residential neighborhood in East York, potentially near a park (Monarch Park). The street names Durant Avenue, Roosevelt Road, Sammon Avenue, Monarch Park Avenue, Strathmore Boulevard, and Linnsmore Crescent provide useful anchors, but the several unnamed segments reduce my certainty. The series of left turns at the start suggests a slightly meandering path, and the long stretch on Monarch Park Avenue is a key part of the route. I'm reasonably confident but some of the shorter segments could be slightly different in reality.
