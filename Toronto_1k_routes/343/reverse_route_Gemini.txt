Explanation: This route is downtown, starting near the Eaton Centre and heading generally west.  The presence of James Street, the Eaton Centre itself, and Walton Street are strong indicators. However, the many turns and some unnamed sections decrease my certainty, particularly the sections inside or around the Eaton Centre which can have complex internal walkways. The beginning portion of the route near Bay and Dundas is fairly clear, but the precise path after that towards University or Spadina becomes less certain without a visual map. Potential POIs, besides the Eaton Centre itself, would be abundant in this area, including numerous shops, restaurants, and City Hall.
