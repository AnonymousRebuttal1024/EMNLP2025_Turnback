Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in Scarborough, potentially near Kingston Road and Midland Avenue based on the coordinates and long, straight segments. A long stretch of 1047.3 meters strongly suggests a major arterial road, possibly Kingston Road. The other segments likely represent smaller side streets.  My confidence is high (90%) because the structure of the route suggests a fairly simple reversal.  However, without access to a map, I cannot be 100% sure about potential one-way streets that might require minor adjustments. Possible POIs near this route could include residential homes, businesses along Kingston Road, and perhaps a park or school.
