Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the area just west of Dufferin and south of Bloor, likely in the Brockton Village neighborhood.  The presence of Dunn Avenue and Cowan Avenue are strong anchors. The relatively long straight section on Dunn suggests a major street within that area.  The numerous shorter turns and segments indicate smaller residential streets.  My confidence is high due to the specific street names provided, although I made a few inferences regarding slight turns.  Potential landmarks near this route could include smaller businesses, restaurants, or parks characteristic of the Brockton Village area.
