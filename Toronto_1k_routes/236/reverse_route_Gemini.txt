Confidence: 90%

The presence of street names (The Heights Drive) significantly increases confidence. This area likely features residential properties, and the turns seem fairly standard. I'm unsure about the precise nature of "slight left," but the overall sequence makes sense geographically. Potential landmarks could include local parks or schools, as is common in residential neighborhoods.  It's also near the East Don River valley.
