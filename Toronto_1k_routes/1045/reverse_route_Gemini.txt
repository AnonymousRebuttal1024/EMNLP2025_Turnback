Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route likely starts near the Exhibition Place and heads east towards downtown. The long 1165.8m segment suggests a major east-west artery like Lake Shore Boulevard West.  Dockside Drive further reinforces this as it's located near the waterfront.  The initial and final shorter segments likely represent navigating smaller streets near the Exhibition grounds and the destination closer to downtown. I'm reasonably confident in the reversal, but the "slight" turns and "keep left" instruction introduce some uncertainty without a visual map to confirm the precise angles and curves. Potential POIs near this route include the Exhibition Place, Ontario Place, and the waterfront parks and trails.
