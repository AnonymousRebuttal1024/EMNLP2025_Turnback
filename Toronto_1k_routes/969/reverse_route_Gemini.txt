Confidence: 90%

This route is in the heart of downtown Toronto, near Ryerson University. I'm very familiar with Gould Street and Nelson Mandela Walk (a pedestrianized area). This area is densely populated with a mix of university buildings, commercial properties, and residential buildings. The short segments and frequent turns suggest a pedestrian route likely navigating the pedestrianized zones and walkways around Ryerson. The presence of named streets and my familiarity with the area give me high confidence.
