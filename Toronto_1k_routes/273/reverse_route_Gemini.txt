Confidence: 85%

The long, straight segment of 1070.0 meters likely indicates a major road, which helps in reversing the direction. However, the lack of street names reduces my certainty.  The "sharp right" and "slight right" instructions offer some helpful details. Based on the coordinates, this route runs roughly north-south through an area just east of the Don River.  Without street names, I am unable to pinpoint specific landmarks but it's likely a mix of residential and commercial properties.
