Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route description uses street names that sound plausible within a residential area of Toronto. The distances are reasonable for city streets. Reversing the route is straightforward given the sequence of turns.  The confidence is high because the navigation is relatively simple and the street names, although not immediately familiar to me, are consistent with the kinds of names used in Toronto's street network.  The specific POIs in this area are likely residential.
