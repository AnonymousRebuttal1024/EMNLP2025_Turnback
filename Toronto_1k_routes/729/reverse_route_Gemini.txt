Confidence: 50%

Reasoning: This route, likely somewhere south of the downtown core near the Gardiner Expressway and Spadina Avenue based on the coordinates, is incredibly complex and involves a large number of turns, many on unnamed roads. The sheer number of turns makes it practically impossible to reverse reliably based on a mental map. I am making many assumptions about the street grid. Potential landmarks are hard to pinpoint with certainty given the complex turns, but it might be near Exhibition Place, given its southwest location from downtown.  My confidence is low because of the very high number of turns and unnamed segments.
