Confidence: 80%

Reason: The route involves numerous turns and several unnamed roads, making it challenging to confidently reverse without a map. While the distances seem plausible for a residential or suburban area of Toronto, the lack of familiarity with the specific street names and their layout lowers the confidence. The reversal is logically consistent but not entirely certain due to the complexity of the route.  There is not enough information to reliably identify nearby POIs, though the route likely passes through a residential area.
