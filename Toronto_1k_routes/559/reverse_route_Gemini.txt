Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be in Rosedale, a residential neighborhood known for its winding streets and ravines. The mention of streets like Douglas Drive, Elm Avenue, Nanton Avenue, and Hawthorn Avenue reinforces this assumption.  These are characteristic street names for the area. The route likely involves navigating the hilly terrain and potentially crossing or going along one of the Rosedale ravines. My confidence is 85%. The street names give me a strong anchor for the general area, but without a map, it's hard to be certain about smaller details or potential one-way streets that might necessitate adjustments. Possible POIs near this route would primarily be residential homes, as well as the Rosedale ravine system and its associated parks and trails.
