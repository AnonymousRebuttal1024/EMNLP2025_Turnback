Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: Millwood Road, Forman Avenue, Belsize Drive, Wilfrid Avenue, and Oswald Crescent provide excellent landmarks.  The route isn't overly complex, and the street names make it relatively easy to visualize the path, increasing my confidence.  The "keep left/right" instructions are likely minor adjustments, and the short segments at the end might represent a driveway or small side street.  Potential POIs include residential buildings along these streets and possibly a nearby park or school. The area seems to be midtown Toronto near Mount Pleasant, based on my familiarity with Toronto's street network and street names.
