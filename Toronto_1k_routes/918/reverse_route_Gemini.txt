Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route starts on Baldwin Street in the Kensington Market neighborhood.  I'm very familiar with this area.  The series of turns is typical for navigating the smaller, sometimes irregular streets of Kensington Market. While I can't be 100% certain without a visual aid, the relatively short distances and the presence of Baldwin Street at the start make me highly confident in the reverse directions. Landmarks near here would include the many vintage shops, restaurants, and street art of Kensington Market, as well as possibly the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) a few blocks to the south.
