Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route is relatively straightforward, with Palmerston Avenue and Wolseley Street serving as good landmarks, placing this likely in the Harbord Village area.  The initial turns suggest navigating local streets before reaching Palmerston, which dominates the route.  I'm fairly confident in the reverse directions given the clear landmarks and the relatively simple structure of the route. I am a little unsure as to the function of the 1.4 meter stretch, but the general direction makes sense.
