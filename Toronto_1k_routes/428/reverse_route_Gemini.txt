Confidence: 70%

The inclusion of a street name (Cranborne Avenue) gives me more confidence than the previous example. I am familiar with the general layout of Toronto's streets, especially east of the Don Valley, and this route seems plausible. However, without more context or a visual map, it's difficult to be absolutely certain about the accuracy of the reversal, especially with the "slight right" and "sharp left" instructions, which could be interpreted slightly differently on the ground. There are no major landmarks I can place with certainty based solely on coordinates and these short distances.  Cranborne Avenue itself is a residential street.
