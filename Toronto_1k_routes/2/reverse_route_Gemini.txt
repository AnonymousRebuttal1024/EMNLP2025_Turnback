Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the North York area, possibly near Downsview Park given the mention of "Veterans Hill Trail." I'm reasonably familiar with the major roads and the general area, but the specific smaller streets like "Hargrave Lane," "Wellness Way," and "Raab Boulevard" are less clear in my mental map.  I am relying on the accuracy of the provided street names and turn directions. Downsview Park and the surrounding residential areas are the likely POIs.
