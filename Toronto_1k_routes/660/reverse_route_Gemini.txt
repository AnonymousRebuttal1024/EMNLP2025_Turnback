Confidence: 75%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the Annex neighborhood, possibly near Yorkville. Mathersfield Drive, Sarah Street, Roden Place, McMurrich Street, McAlpine Street, and Blackmore Street are likely residential streets in that area, creating a winding path.  The lack of easily recognizable main roads makes it harder to keep track of the overall direction without a visual aid. I'm moderately confident based on the sequence of streets provided, but the many turns and shorter segments reduce my certainty.  Potential POIs might include residential buildings and possibly a small park in the area.  It's a little difficult to pinpoint more precise landmarks without seeing it on a map.
