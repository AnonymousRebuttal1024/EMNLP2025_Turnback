Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: Yonge Street and Warren Road provide clear landmarks, increasing my confidence significantly. Yonge Street is a major north-south artery in Toronto.  The route itself is relatively straightforward with a few turns. The "keep left" likely indicates staying on a main road, possibly Yonge Street itself. Potential POIs include businesses along Yonge Street and residential buildings near Warren Road. The location seems to be midtown Toronto, possibly near Davisville or Mount Pleasant, given the presence of Yonge Street and my understanding of Toronto's street layout.
