Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the Corso Italia neighborhood, based on the mention of St. Clarens Avenue and Glenholme Avenue, which are in that area.  Crang Avenue and the "Lane North Saint Clair West Oakwood" further suggest this location as being near St. Clair Avenue West.  The long straight stretch of 894.5 meters likely follows a major road, possibly St. Clair West itself.  I'm reasonably confident (80%) in the reversed directions, especially the beginning and end segments. However, without a map, I'm less certain about the smaller lane connection and the potential presence of one-way streets that could require adjustments.  Likely POIs along this route could include residential homes, local businesses along St. Clair West, and possibly Earlscourt Park which is somewhat nearby.
