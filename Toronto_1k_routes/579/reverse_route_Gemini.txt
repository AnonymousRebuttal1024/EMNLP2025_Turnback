Confidence: 90%

This route appears to be in the Wychwood neighborhood, north of St. Clair West. The presence of Kenwood Avenue, Lauretta Brooks Lane, Wychwood Avenue, Lane South Vaughan West Wychwood, Pinewood Avenue, and Atlas Avenue makes me very confident about the location and the reverse directions.  The area is largely residential with some commercial activity along St. Clair.  Potential landmarks could include Humewood Park and the Wychwood Barns community center.
