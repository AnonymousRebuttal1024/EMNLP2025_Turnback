Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in North York, likely near Yonge Street and Sheppard Avenue, based on street names like Belsize and Forman. I'm quite familiar with the general layout of that area, which tends to have winding residential streets. The instructions are relatively straightforward, with longer stretches on Belsize and Tullis, making the reverse route easy to deduce.  The presence of smaller turns and "keep right/left" instructions suggests some potential cul-de-sacs or slight curves, but the overall path seems clear. I'm less familiar with the specific smaller streets like Wilfrid and Tullis, so there's a small margin of error. Possible POIs near this route could include parks and schools in the neighbourhood.
