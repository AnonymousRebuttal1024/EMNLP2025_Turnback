Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be in the Bloor West Village area, connecting a point near High Park to a point closer to Runnymede Station.  Key landmarks like Runnymede Public School, the subway station, and the shops along Bloor West Village are likely nearby.  The inclusion of street names like Windermere, Willard, Colbeck, Kennedy, and Glenlake significantly boosts my confidence. I'm slightly less sure about the initial and final short segments, as their precise angles could vary, but the overall route reconstruction is likely accurate.
