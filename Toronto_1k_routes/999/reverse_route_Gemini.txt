Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Forest Hill North area near Bathurst Street and Eglinton Avenue West. Albany Avenue and Vermont Avenue are in this area. Tandy Murch Lane is a very small laneway. The 529.9-meter segment is likely along Bathurst Street.  The shorter segments and turns represent residential street navigation.  The presence of the named streets gives me relatively high confidence.
