Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the Wallace Emerson neighborhood, near Dupont Street and Lansdowne Avenue. Geary Avenue and Bristol Avenue are located in this industrial area.  The very long 1136-meter segment likely follows Dupont Street. The other, shorter segments represent navigating the smaller industrial streets. My confidence is good because of the named streets.
