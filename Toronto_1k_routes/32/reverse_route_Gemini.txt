Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: My confidence is 90% because the route includes several named streets (Jarvis Street, Maitland Street, Isabella Street, Cumberland Terrace Ground Floor) which act as landmarks.  The reversal of the turns is straightforward. However, some shorter segments and the less common name "Cumberland Terrace Ground Floor" introduce a small amount of uncertainty. The overall accuracy is good, but minor deviations may occur in the reversed route due to my imprecise knowledge of the exact street layout.
