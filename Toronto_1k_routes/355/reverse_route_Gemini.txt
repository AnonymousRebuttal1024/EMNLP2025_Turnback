Explanation: This route appears to be near the intersection of St. Clair and Avenue Road, extending westward.  The presence of Cottingham Street, Poplar Plains Road, and MacPherson Avenue strongly supports this. The long final eastward leg likely follows a major road, potentially St. Clair Avenue West.  The other turns suggest navigating smaller residential streets. Potential POIs include residential homes, possibly the Kay Gardner Beltline Trail, and businesses along St. Clair.
