Confidence: 60%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Rockcliffe-Smythe neighborhood in the west end. While street names like Gabian Way, Kane Avenue, Cameron Avenue, Avon Drive, and Bicknell Avenue help, the high number of turns, changes in direction, and short, unnamed segments makes accurate reversal from memory very challenging.  I'm less confident in the precise sequence of turns, particularly in the residential areas with smaller streets.  Potential landmarks/POIs could include the Smythe Park or the Black Creek ravine, although pinning down the precise location is difficult with this complex route.
