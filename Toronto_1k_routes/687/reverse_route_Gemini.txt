Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the Junction Area, likely using Dundas Street West as a major artery for the long 901.1m segment. The shorter segments before and after likely navigate smaller residential streets.  I'm reasonably confident in the overall reversal, but the multiple short segments and lack of street names make it slightly harder to be absolutely precise. Potential landmarks could include the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks or the commercial/industrial buildings along Dundas Street West.
