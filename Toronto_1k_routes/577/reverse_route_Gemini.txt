Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the area just west of Dufferin Street and south of Bloor Street West, potentially near the Brockton Village neighborhood. The long stretches with "keep left/right" suggest navigating along larger streets, possibly Dundas Street West or College Street West, with some smaller turns onto side streets. The lack of street names makes it harder to be completely certain.  I'm reasonably confident in the general flow of the reverse route but less so about the precise locations of the turns without more specific information. Potential landmarks could include residential buildings, small businesses, or potentially a park given the longer stretches.
