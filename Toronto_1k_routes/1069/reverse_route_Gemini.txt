Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: The coordinates suggest a location in the Weston area, potentially near Eglinton Avenue West. The relatively few instructions and the long straight sections increase my confidence in the overall reversal. I suspect the route involves major roads, potentially along Weston Road or Jane Street.  While I don't have specific street names, the overall direction and distances make the reversed directions reasonably reliable. Potential landmarks near this route might include the shops and restaurants along Eglinton Ave W or potentially the Humber River.
