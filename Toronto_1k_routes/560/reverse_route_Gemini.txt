Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be in the Exhibition Place/Liberty Village area, based on the coordinates and the relatively few turns and moderate distances. The multiple "keep right" instructions suggest navigating along a curved road or a series of gentle bends, possibly near the Exhibition grounds or the Gardiner Expressway ramps. My confidence is 90% because the route structure appears straightforward to reverse.  However, without a map, I cannot be completely certain about minor street details and any potential one-way sections that might require small adjustments. Possible POIs include Exhibition Place venues, the BMO Field, and residential/commercial buildings in Liberty Village.
