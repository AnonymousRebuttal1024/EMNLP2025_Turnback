Confidence: 80%

Explanation: This route seems to be in the Victoria Park and Danforth area, north of the Danforth. Bartley Drive, Northline Road, Blair Street, and Tucker Street seem like residential streets in this area, near the Don Valley Parkway. The several "sharp" turns likely correspond to the curves and bends as roads go down and up the valley slopes.  The starting point "Bartley Access Point" suggests a path or small road leading to/from a ravine area, possibly the Don Valley trails. I'm fairly confident due to the named streets, especially Bartley Drive, but the "slight" turns introduce a little uncertainty as they are less precise. Possible POIs might include the trails and parkland in the Don Valley, or residential buildings in the Victoria Park area.
