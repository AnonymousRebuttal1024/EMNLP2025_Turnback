Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Wexford neighborhood of Scarborough, near Victoria Park Avenue and Lawrence Avenue East. I am quite familiar with Victoria Park Avenue, and the presence of streets like Edge Park Avenue, Hollydene Road, Evandale Road, Fairfax Crescent, and Monastery Lane strengthens my confidence in this location. These are typical residential streets in that area.  The mix of longer and shorter segments suggests a realistic walking route. Warden Woods park is a potential landmark nearby although the route seems slightly east of the park itself.
