**Confidence: 85%**

**Reason:** The detailed path provides a comprehensive map of actions necessary to reverse the route. Alignment of turns and nuanced directions (e.g., "sharp right," "slight left," "keep right") contributes to accurate route reversals. A minor decrease in confidence arises due to the extent/length of the route, which spans multiple direction changes and segments, requiring careful adherence to the directional queues. Areas like Richmond Adelaide Centre Courtyard possibly involve more intricate navigation because of their structural and traffic-specific details, adding complexity.
