Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in a residential area, possibly near Steeles Avenue West and Weston Road, in the northwest part of Toronto.  While I don't immediately recognize Tilbury Drive, the relatively few turns and longer stretches on unnamed streets make the reverse directions relatively straightforward.  The "turn left" and "turn right" instructions are easily inverted. Potential POIs might include residential buildings and possibly a local park. The simplicity of the route increases my confidence.
