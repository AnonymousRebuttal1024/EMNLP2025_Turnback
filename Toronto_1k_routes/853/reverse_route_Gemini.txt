Confidence: 95%

Reasoning: Willcocks Street and Hart House Circle provide very strong landmarks, as Hart House is a prominent building on the University of Toronto campus. This makes me highly confident about the route, especially the beginning and end. The route seems to navigate within the university campus, with a loop around Hart House. Potential POIs include university buildings, Hart House Theatre, and various campus facilities.
