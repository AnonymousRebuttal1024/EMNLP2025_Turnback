Confidence: 70%

This route seems to be in the Regal Heights neighbourhood, near the intersection of Davenport Road and Shaw Street.  The inclusion of Lambertlodge Avenue, Melita Avenue, Larry Priestman Lane, Shaw Street, Marchmount Road, Lt. John Roberts Kenmure, and Regal Road helps, but the many short segments and turns, especially in the beginning and middle of the route, make it hard to be entirely sure. The area is residential, and the route likely winds through these streets.  I'm less certain without visual confirmation, especially given the many very short segments.  Casa Loma could be a potential landmark visible from parts of the route.
