Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the High Park/Swansea area, close to Bloor West Village, as indicated by Trinity Circle. The presence of "Trinity Circle" twice in the directions suggests a looping or semi-circular road.  The numerous short segments, turns, and “keep left/right” instructions make it a little challenging to reconstruct precisely from memory.  I have a reasonable mental image of the area, but the specific turns are harder to place precisely. Potential landmarks could include High Park and the surrounding residential area.
