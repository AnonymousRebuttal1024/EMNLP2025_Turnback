Explanation: This route is likely in the Lytton Park neighborhood, based on the street names (Gloucester Grove, Strathearn Road, Ava Road) and the coordinates.  I'm reasonably familiar with the general area.  Ava Road is a significant street in that neighborhood. The simplicity of the route contributes to my confidence level. POIs might include residential buildings and potentially a nearby park or school, as the area is primarily residential.
