Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route is quite complex with numerous turns, suggesting navigation through a residential area. The street names Foxley, Dovercourt, Lisgar, Brock, and Seaforth are useful anchors, pointing towards the west end, likely near Dufferin Grove.  However, many unnamed short segments reduce my confidence.  "Slight left" and the numerous "turn right/left" instructions without distances are ambiguous.  I'm reasonably confident about the main street sections, but less so about the precise sequence of shorter turns.
