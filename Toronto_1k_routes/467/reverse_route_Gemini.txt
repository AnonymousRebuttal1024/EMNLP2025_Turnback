Confidence: 80%

The inclusion of "Paton Road," "St. Clarens Avenue," "Wallace Avenue," and "Emerson Avenue" significantly improves confidence. This area is in the west end's Brockton Village, just north of Dundas Street West.  The "sharp left" and "slight" turns, combined with "keep left" instructions, suggest a mix of angled intersections and potentially some curving roads. The longer segments indicate larger roads within a residential grid, such as Dundas or Bloor Street.  I'm reasonably confident in the reversal, but there's some uncertainty due to the multiple "keep left" and nuanced turns that are difficult to visualize precisely without a map.  Dufferin Grove Park is a potential landmark nearby.
