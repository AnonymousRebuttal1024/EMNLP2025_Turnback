Confidence: 80%

This route appears to be in the East York area, near Taylor Creek Park. The specific trail and street names like Westlake Crescent, Chisholm Avenue, Taylor Creek Hydro Corridor Trail, Corduroy Lane, Rexleigh Drive/Climb, Glen Albert Drive, Curran Drive, Ferris Road, and Plaxton Drive increase my confidence. The route likely involves residential streets and park trails/paths.  However, the numerous short segments make it somewhat challenging to visualize the precise route without a map, lowering my overall confidence. Taylor Creek Park is a significant landmark in this area.
