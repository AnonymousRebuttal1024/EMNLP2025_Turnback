Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route involves a series of turns through what seems to be a residential area of Toronto. The street names (Gamble Avenue, Logan Avenue, Floyd Avenue, Lippert Lane) are plausible, but I don't have perfect recall of the exact layout of these smaller streets and their relative positions.  The distances are reasonable for city blocks.  The reversal is straightforward given the sequence of turns. However, the less familiar street names and the number of turns reduce my confidence slightly.  POIs near the route are likely to be residential.
