Confidence: 60%

Explanation: This route appears to be in the west end, likely near High Park or the Junction Triangle, given the presence of Osler Street. I'm somewhat confident about the long stretches along Osler, but the many short turns and unnamed segments suggest navigating smaller residential streets, making it harder to be precise. It's possible some of these turns represent navigating around small parks or dead ends common in that area. Potential POIs could include residential homes, small local businesses, and possibly High Park itself (if the route is closer to the park's boundaries).
