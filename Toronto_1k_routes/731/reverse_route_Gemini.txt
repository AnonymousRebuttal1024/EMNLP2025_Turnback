Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route is likely in Rosedale, a neighborhood known for its winding streets and ravines, based on street names like Roxborough, Chestnut Park, May, and South Drive. The presence of these names is very helpful.  However, many short, unnamed segments and curves ("keep right," "keep left") make it hard to reconstruct with full accuracy from memory.  I have a general idea of Rosedale's layout but pinpointing these exact turns is challenging.  Potential landmarks could include Rosedale Valley Road and the parkland surrounding it.
