Confidence: 99%

Reasoning: The reversal is highly confident due to the straightforward nature of the route.  The street names and their sequence are easily identifiable and their relative positions are accurate.  The only possible source of minor error could be slight variations in the exact turning points, but the overall route's logic is sound. The area is residential, near the Don River, and doesn't have major landmarks directly on this route.
