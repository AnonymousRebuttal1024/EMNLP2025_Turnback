Confidence: 65%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the area of Woodbine Gardens/East York, not far from the previous example. Gamble and Woodycrest Avenues exist in this area, aiding my understanding of the general location. The very high number of turns indicates navigation through residential streets, with a potential for inaccuracies due to small lanes, alleys, or slight deviations. My confidence is lowered by the "slight" turn modifiers, which are hard to precisely reverse without visual aid. Potential landmarks might include residential homes, Mortimer Avenue Public School, or Stan Wadlow Park slightly to the west.
