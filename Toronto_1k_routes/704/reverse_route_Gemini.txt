Confidence: 80%

This route seems to be in the Junction Triangle, near the intersection of Dundas Street West and Dupont Street. The numerous turns suggest smaller streets typical of a residential area. I'm reasonably confident in the overall reversal, but the lack of street names and the shorter segments make the precise angles of some turns less certain. The Canadian Pacific Railway lines may be a nearby landmark.
