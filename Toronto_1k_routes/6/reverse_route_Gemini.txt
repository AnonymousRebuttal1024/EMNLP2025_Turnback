Reasoning: This is a very short route with a long straight segment.  The mention of "Brookside Drive" gives a good anchor point. I'm quite familiar with the general layout of the eastern part of Toronto and the areas near the Don Valley Parkway, where Brookside Drive exists.  While I might not know the exact curvature of Brookside Drive, reversing this simple route is fairly straightforward. Todmorden Mills and the Don Valley Parkway are notable POIs near this route.
