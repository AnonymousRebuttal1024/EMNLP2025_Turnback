Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: My confidence is 70% because this route involves several short segments and turns, making precise reversal more difficult without visual aids or detailed street information.  The inclusion of "Sammon Avenue" provides a better landmark, increasing confidence compared to the previous example, but the numerous minor turns and short distances still introduce uncertainty.  I am assuming the turns are relatively accurate, but minor deviations in the real-world route could lead to slight differences in the reversed directions.  The lack of context about the neighborhood also limits my confidence.
