Reasoning: This route is likely in the Flemingdon Park/Thorncliffe Park neighbourhood, given the mention of Don Mills Road. The route seems to involve a mix of residential streets and possibly some service roads within the neighborhood. The relatively few turns and the presence of Don Mills Road increases my confidence.  Possible landmarks could include residential buildings, the Don Valley Parkway to the west, or some local shops along Don Mills Road.
