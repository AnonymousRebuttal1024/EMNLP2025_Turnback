Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route is a series of turns that seem plausible for a Toronto residential area. The distances are reasonable. The reversal is straightforward, following the turns in reverse order.  The slight reduction in confidence comes from not having a complete mental picture of the precise layout of streets in that specific area.  However, the directions themselves are easy to reverse.  The area is likely residential, so POIs would be houses.
