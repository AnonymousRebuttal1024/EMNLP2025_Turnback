Confidence: 95%

Reason: The route is relatively straightforward, but the inclusion of "keep right/left" instructions and several slight turns introduces a small degree of uncertainty in the precise reversal. The street name "Jones Avenue" is helpful for the final part of the route. The area is likely a mix of residential and possibly some industrial areas.  There are likely no major easily identifiable landmarks along the route except for Jones Avenue itself.
