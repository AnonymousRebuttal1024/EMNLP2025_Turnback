Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be in a residential neighborhood, possibly near the intersection of Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue. Chatsworth Drive and Duplex Avenue are familiar streets in that area. The short distances and turns suggest a residential area.  I'm reasonably confident (85%) in the reversed directions as they follow a logical path, but without a map, minor adjustments might be necessary due to potential one-way streets or small lanes.  Likely POIs in this area would include residential homes, possibly a small park, and perhaps some local businesses on the nearby main streets.
