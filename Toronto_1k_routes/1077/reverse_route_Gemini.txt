Confidence: 75%

Reasoning:  "Sixplay," "Armistice Drive," and "Wellness Way" are identifiable within Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre campus.  This makes the latter half of the reversal fairly certain. However, the beginning section with only directional cues and multiple short segments makes precise reversal tricky.  "Sixplay" appears to be an internal road or pathway within the hospital complex. POIs would be Sunnybrook Hospital buildings and facilities themselves.
