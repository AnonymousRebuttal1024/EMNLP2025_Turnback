Confidence: 80%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the North York area, possibly near the Don Valley Parkway and York Mills Road, based on the presence of Rumsey Road and the general pattern of turns. The "Wellness Way" segment suggests a newer development or possibly a park area. While I'm confident about the initial and parts of the middle sections (thanks to Rumsey Road), the many turns, including "keep left/right" instructions, and the unfamiliar "Wellness Way" segment introduce uncertainty.  Landmarks might include residential homes, parkland along the Don River, or potentially some office buildings.
