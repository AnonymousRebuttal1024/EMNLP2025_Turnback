Confidence: 90%

Explanation: This route is within the Eaton Centre mall, based on the starting instruction and coordinates. While I don't know the precise interior layout, the sequence of turns suggests navigation within a multi-level building. Reversing the directions within the mall is relatively straightforward, assuming the path remains accessible. POIs would include shops, restaurants, and mall entrances to surrounding streets like Yonge, Dundas, and Queen.  My confidence is high due to the contained environment of a mall, even though I don't have specific internal map knowledge.
