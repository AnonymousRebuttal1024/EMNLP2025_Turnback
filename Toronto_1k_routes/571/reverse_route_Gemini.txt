Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be in the Parkdale neighborhood, likely south of Queen Street West, based on the presence of Margueretta Street and Gladstone Avenue. I am fairly confident in the accuracy of the reverse directions due to the inclusion of street names, although I've made some assumptions about "keep left/right" instructions. Potential landmarks might include residential buildings, small businesses, and potentially Trinity Bellwoods Park if the route extends further north.
