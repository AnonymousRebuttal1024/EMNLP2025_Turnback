Confidence: 75%

This route seems to be in a residential area east of Victoria Park Avenue, potentially north of Danforth Avenue.  The relatively short distances and turns suggest smaller streets. The lack of specific street names makes it harder to pinpoint the exact location and surrounding landmarks. I have decent confidence in the general sequence of turns, but the initial and final "head" directions are based on relative bearings from the coordinates, and the "slight right" and "keep right" are interpretations that could vary slightly in reality.  I am less confident about landmarks in this area without more specific location information.
