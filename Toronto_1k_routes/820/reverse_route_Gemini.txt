Confidence: 85%

Reasoning:  Canniff Street offers a good landmark. The numerous short turns and the "sharp right" suggest a slightly more complex route potentially involving smaller streets or laneways. The two "keep left" instructions likely indicate staying on the same road at gentle curves or forks. Potential POIs might include residential buildings, perhaps some small businesses along Canniff, and possibly a parkette or green space given the location is likely in the west end, maybe near the Junction area, based on my general knowledge of Toronto.
