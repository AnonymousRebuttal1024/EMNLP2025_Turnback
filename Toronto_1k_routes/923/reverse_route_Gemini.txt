Confidence: 60%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the Woodbine Heights area, based on street names like Eaton, Aldwych, Sammon and Minton. I'm familiar with the general area, but the large number of turns, many with "slight" modifiers, makes the precise path difficult to reconstruct in reverse. I'm less sure about the smaller streets and whether I correctly interpreted all the turning angles. Possible landmarks could include residential homes, Taylor Creek Park to the west, or small businesses along Danforth Avenue to the south.
