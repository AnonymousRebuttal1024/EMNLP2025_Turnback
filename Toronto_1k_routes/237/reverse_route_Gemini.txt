Confidence: 85%

The long, uninterrupted segment of 1187.8 meters suggests a major road or thoroughfare.  This reduces the complexity of the route, increasing confidence.  The "slight left" introduces some uncertainty, and the lack of street names makes it difficult to pinpoint exact locations or landmarks. However, based on the coordinates, this route likely traverses a residential area near the Don Valley Parkway.  Potential landmarks might include parks, schools, or commercial areas along the main road.
