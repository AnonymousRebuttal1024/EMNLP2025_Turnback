Confidence: 90%

Explanation: The route navigates through downtown Toronto, likely between the heart of Chinatown and towards Kensington Market, featuring many short turns indicative of the narrower, bustling streets common to this area. Streets like Grange Avenue and D'Arcy Street are quite central and embody the kind of circulating paths you'd find in one of Toronto's cultural districts. By closely mirroring the sequence of directions while explicitly addressing reversal in street names and turns, our approach reflects a high level of confidence. This sort of area boosts confidence due to typical street patterns and accurate route tracing.
