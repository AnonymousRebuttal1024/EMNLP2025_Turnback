**Confidence: 92%**

**Reason:** The directions include identifiable streets and specified distances, facilitating straightforward reversals. Named roads such as Stamford Square and Karnwood Drive provide a strong framework for consistent pathway navigation. Predominantly linear directions with few complex rearrangements ensure effective trailing, leading to reliable and explicit instruction reversal across cohesive translational decision-making. This foundation drives confidence based on accurate arrangement of directional flow components.
