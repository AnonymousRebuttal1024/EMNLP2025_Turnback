Confidence: 90%

Reason: The route is fairly complex with many turns and some short segments. Reversing it is straightforward, but the lack of street names (besides Manitoba Street at the very end) reduces the certainty of precise geographic placement within Toronto.  The “slight right” turn also introduces a minor source of potential error in the reversed route.  While I can confidently reverse the directions, the precision of the distances and the exact nature of the slight turn are less certain without more context.  The area is likely residential but I cannot pinpoint the exact location.
