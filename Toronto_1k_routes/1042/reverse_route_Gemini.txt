Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the Bloordale Village/Brockton Village area, west of downtown Toronto, close to the intersection of Dundas Street West and Lansdowne Avenue. The specific mention of Lansdowne Avenue and West Lodge Avenue strongly anchors the route and increases my confidence. The short segments and turns are typical of residential streets in this area. The "keep right" segment likely indicates a slight curve or bend in the road. POIs near this route could include the shops and restaurants along Dundas West, Dufferin Grove Park, or the residential areas surrounding Lansdowne and West Lodge.
