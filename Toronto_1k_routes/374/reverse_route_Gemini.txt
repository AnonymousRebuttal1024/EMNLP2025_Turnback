Confidence: 85%

Explanation: This route appears to be in East York, specifically in the Woodbine Gardens neighbourhood. The presence of Roblin Avenue, Binswood Avenue, Cosburn Avenue, Sammon Avenue and Woodington Avenue provide strong location markers. The numerous turns suggest navigating the primarily residential streets of this area. My confidence is relatively high due to these street names, though some shorter segments could introduce minor inaccuracies without a visual map. Potential POIs might include residential homes, potentially a local park or school, and businesses along O'Connor Drive, a major road which is likely nearby.
