Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route seems to be around the Stockyards/Junction Triangle area, west of downtown. Northland Avenue and Brickworks Lane exist in that area and suggest industrial or mixed-use land. I'm relatively confident in the reconstruction, as there aren't too many turns. The "keep left/right" instructions introduce a slight ambiguity about which fork in the road was taken, but the street names at the beginning and end help.  Landmarks might include the Evergreen Brick Works itself (a bit further east), industrial buildings, or some residential areas to the south.
