Reasoning: The inclusion of Wolfrey Avenue and Bowden Street provides a solid anchor for this route, placing it in the Riverdale neighborhood, east of the Don Valley Parkway. While the initial turns before the long straight stretch are less certain without street names, the overall reversal, especially the final part involving the named streets, is quite reliable.  Potential POIs nearby include Riverdale Park East, the Don Valley Parkway trails, and possibly some shops and restaurants along Broadview Avenue.
