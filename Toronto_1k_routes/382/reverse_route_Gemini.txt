Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: This route is much simpler than the previous one, involving fewer turns and longer stretches on what seem to be main roads.  The starting point is likely near York Mills Rd and Yonge St based on the coordinates.  The general direction and distances seem plausible for connecting two points in this area, likely close to the Yonge-Eglinton area and the intersection of Yonge and Erskine.  Possible POIs include the shops and restaurants along Yonge Street. The fewer turns and longer distances increase my confidence in the reverse directions.
