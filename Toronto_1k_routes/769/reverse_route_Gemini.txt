This route is very straightforward, involving only two turns. The starting and ending coordinates suggest a primarily north-south movement along Logan Avenue. I'm quite familiar with the general grid layout of Toronto, and this type of short, direct route is common.  The only slight uncertainty comes from the very short 3-meter segment, which might represent a slight jog in the road or a driveway. However, this doesn't impact the overall reversal of the directions.  This route is likely close to Queen Street East and Leslieville area based on the coordinates.
