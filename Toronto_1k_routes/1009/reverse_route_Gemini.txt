Confidence: 85%

This route likely starts near Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue and heads east toward Bayview Avenue. The very long 1184.7-meter segment strongly suggests it's on Manor Road East, a major east-west residential street that runs parallel south of Eglinton, across this whole area. Hillsdale Avenue West is a smaller residential street that intersects with Yonge Street.  My confidence is relatively high due to the presence of these named streets, and the overall route structure seems plausible.
