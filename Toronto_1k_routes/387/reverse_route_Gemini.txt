Confidence: 65%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the East York area, potentially near the intersection of O'Connor and St. Clair East. The specific streets mentioned (Glenwood Crescent, St. Columba Place, St. Clair Avenue East) help anchor the route. However, the high number of turns and short distances, especially at the beginning and end, make it difficult to be highly confident without a visual aid.  Potential POIs include the shops and businesses along St. Clair East, and potentially the ravine near Taylor Creek Park if it's close enough.
