Confidence: 90%

This route seems to be primarily along Windermere Avenue, based on the long 953.9m segment and the coordinates which suggest a location in the Swansea/High Park area. This makes reversing the route relatively straightforward. The short segments and turns at the beginning and end likely represent maneuvering near the start and destination points, possibly involving driveways or short side streets.  The "keep right" instructions suggest slight curves or bends in the road. High Park and the shops and restaurants along Bloor Street West would be potential POIs near this route.
