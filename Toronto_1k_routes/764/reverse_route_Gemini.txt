Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route is likely in the downtown core, close to the Church and Wellesley area.  Mutual Street is a key landmark. The numerous short segments and turns, however, make precise reversal challenging. I'm confident about the general location and the segment involving Mutual Street, but less so about the exact sequence of the shorter, unnamed sections. Potential landmarks might include the Metropolitan United Church or the Wellesley subway station, depending on how close the route gets to them.
