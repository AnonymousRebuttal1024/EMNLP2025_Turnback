Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be located in the western part of Toronto, potentially near Long Branch based on the coordinates.  The relatively long, straight segment suggests a major road, while the other shorter segments likely represent turns onto smaller residential streets. The "slight right" instruction adds a small degree of uncertainty, but the overall route is fairly straightforward to reverse. I'm quite confident in the reversal, but there could be minor discrepancies without a street map to confirm. No readily identifiable landmarks come to mind based on the coordinates and distances alone, but this is likely a mixed residential and commercial area.
