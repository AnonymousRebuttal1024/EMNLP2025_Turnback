Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route seems to be in the Don Valley area, likely near Edwards Gardens, based on the presence of "Wilket Creek Trail" and "Paperbirch Walkway". These names suggest park paths or trails.  The starting coordinates place it near the intersection of Leslie and Lawrence, which supports this assumption.  The many turns and distances, especially on unnamed paths, make it challenging to be highly confident in the reversal without a map. Potential POIs could be Edwards Gardens, the Toronto Botanical Garden, or the shops along Leslie Street.
