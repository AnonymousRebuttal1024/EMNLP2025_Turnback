Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route appears relatively straightforward, with a few longer stretches and a generally south-to-north direction.  The starting point is likely near Warden Station/Warden and Ellesmere, the longer segments suggest major roads. Lack of specific street names introduces some uncertainty, but the overall simplicity increases confidence in the reversal. Potential POIs might include Warden subway station, or businesses along Warden Avenue.
