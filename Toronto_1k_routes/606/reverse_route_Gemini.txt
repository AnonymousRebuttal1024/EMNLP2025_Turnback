This route seems to be heading generally northeast from near the intersection of Don Mills Road and O'Connor Drive, ending near the Don Valley Parkway and Taylor Creek Park. Sutherland Drive provides an anchor point. The long initial stretch before Sutherland suggests following a major road like Don Mills Road, while Sutherland Drive itself is within a more residential area closer to the Don Valley.  I'm reasonably confident, particularly with the Sutherland Drive marker, though the lack of specific streets for the longer segment reduces the certainty somewhat. Potential landmarks could include the shops and businesses along Don Mills Road and the green spaces of Taylor Creek Park.
