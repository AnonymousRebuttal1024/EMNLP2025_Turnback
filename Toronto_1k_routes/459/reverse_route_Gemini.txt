Confidence: 90%

The presence of street names "St. Nicholas Street" and "St. Joseph Street" makes this reversal quite straightforward. These streets are located near the University of Toronto and suggest a residential area with some institutional buildings.  The relatively short distances and turns point to navigation through a fairly standard grid pattern. I have high confidence in the reversal due to the named streets, although minor uncertainties always exist without visual confirmation.  The University of Toronto is a major landmark nearby.
