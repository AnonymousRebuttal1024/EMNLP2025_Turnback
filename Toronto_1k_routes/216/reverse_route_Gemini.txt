Confidence: 98%

Reason: The route is relatively straightforward, with a clear sequence of turns and distances. The street names (Atkins, Sheridan, Rusholme, Montrose Avenues) are easily recognizable in the context of Toronto's street network.  The reversal is easy; the only potential for error is minor variations in the precise location of turns or distance measurements, especially with the shorter segments. The area is likely residential, possibly near High Park.
