Confidence: 85%

Symes Road, Glen Scarlett Road, Gunns Road, and Tarragona Boulevard provide good anchors.  The numerous turns, including "slight left/right," suggest navigating local streets and potentially some industrial areas given the location in the western part of the city, near the border with York Region. This is generally a less densely populated area compared to downtown. I am slightly less confident due to several "slight" turns and "keep left/right" instructions, which can be ambiguous. However, the named roads help significantly.
