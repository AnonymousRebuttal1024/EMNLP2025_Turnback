Confidence: 90%

Reasoning:  The presence of street names like Logan Avenue, Natalie Place, and Dundas Street East firmly places this route in the Leslieville neighborhood, east of the downtown core.  These streets, especially Dundas St E, serve as excellent anchor points for reversing the directions.  While there are a few turns without street names, the relatively short distances and the overall context make the reversal reasonably accurate. POIs nearby include the shops and restaurants along Queen Street East, Jimmie Simpson Park, and potentially the Ashbridge Estate further south.
