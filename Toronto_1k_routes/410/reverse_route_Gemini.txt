Confidence: 75%

Reasoning: This route is in the  Mount Dennis/Weston area, likely near the intersection of Eglinton and Weston Road. Street names like Sheffield, Kincort, Caledonia and Raitherm confirm this.  The numerous turns and short segments, however, suggest a complex route through residential streets, which decreases confidence in a purely textual reversal. POIs might include businesses along Eglinton Avenue West.
