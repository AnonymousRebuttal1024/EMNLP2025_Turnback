Confidence: 75%

This route seems to be in East York, potentially near the Taylor-Massey Creek ravine. The presence of street names like Gower, Meighen, Donora, and Crescent Place helps with identifying the area. I'm confident about the central part of the route thanks to these street names. However, the beginning and end of the route have several short segments and sharp turns, making it difficult to be absolutely precise without more context or visual confirmation.  The Don Valley Parkway might be a nearby landmark depending on the exact position.
