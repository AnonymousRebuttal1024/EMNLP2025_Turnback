Confidence: 85%

This route appears to be in the Upper Beaches, near Woodbine and Danforth Avenues. The inclusion of Woodmount, Frater, and Queensdale Avenues gives me a reasonable level of confidence in identifying the location and reversing the route. Woodbine Park may be a nearby landmark, along with the shops and restaurants along Danforth Avenue.  I'm slightly less certain about the initial short segments and "keep right/left" instructions without street names, but the overall reversal is likely accurate.
