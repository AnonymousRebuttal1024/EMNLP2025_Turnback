Confidence: 85%

Reasoning: This route appears to be in the west end, near the Junction area based on the presence of the West Toronto Railpath and Wallace Avenue. The railpath itself is a very distinctive landmark.  The "keep right" instruction introduces some ambiguity, but the overall north to slightly northeast movement suggested by the coordinates and relatively few turns makes me fairly confident in the reversed directions.  I've reduced the confidence a little because I'm not totally sure about the exact nature of the "keep right".
