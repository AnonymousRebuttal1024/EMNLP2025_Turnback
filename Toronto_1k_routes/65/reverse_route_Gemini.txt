Confidence: 70%

This route appears to be in a residential area possibly near Warden and Eglinton based on street names like Curity and Cranfield.  I'm reasonably confident in the reversal because the instructions are straightforward and suggest a fairly grid-like street pattern. However, without precise map data, there's a chance of small errors due to slight curves in roads or unmentioned alleys.  Dohme Avenue being named adds confidence as it anchors the route to a known street in Toronto. I don't have information regarding specific POIs near this route, beyond inferring it's residential.
