Confidence: 75%

Reason: This route includes several turns on streets I don't recognize ("Jenoves Place," "Ditty Lane", and "Escalator from Eaton Centre level 2 to 3" which is not a street). While the reversal is logically sound, the lack of familiarity with these street names and the numerous short segments make precise reversal difficult.  The distances seem plausible for a city setting, but the unfamiliar street names significantly lower my confidence.  The mention of Eaton Centre does help ground the end of the route and provides a known POI.  However, without knowing the precise locations of the smaller streets, reversing the route precisely is highly uncertain.
