Confidence: 70%

This route seems to be in the Church-Wellesley Village area, given the presence of St. Luke Lane. The numerous turns and short segments suggest a complex route likely going through smaller residential streets. I'm moderately confident about the central portion, thanks to the named street.  However, the beginning and end portions, with their multiple short segments, are harder to reconstruct precisely. The numerous turns also make it difficult to maintain a precise sense of direction without visual cues. Potential landmarks could include the Church Street businesses or residential buildings in the area.
