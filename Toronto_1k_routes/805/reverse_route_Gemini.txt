Confidence: 85%

This route seems to be in the Annex neighbourhood, close to the University of Toronto, based on the coordinates and the mention of Wells Street, Kendal Avenue, and Walmer Road.  These streets provide good anchors. The multiple short segments and turns likely represent navigating smaller residential streets or laneways, and the "keep right" indicates a slight curve, making it a bit harder to be certain about the precise reversal. POIs might include the University of Toronto and various businesses along Bloor Street.
