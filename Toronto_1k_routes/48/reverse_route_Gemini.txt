Reasoning: The reversal is largely accurate, tracing the original route backward.  However, the numerous short segments and several sharp turns introduce a degree of uncertainty.  Small variations in the precise turning points or segment lengths are possible depending on the GPS data and mapping service. The area is near the waterfront and the CN Tower, but no specific landmarks are directly on this somewhat circuitous route.
