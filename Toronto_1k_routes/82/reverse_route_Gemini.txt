Confidence: 95%

Reason:  The route is a relatively straightforward segment along Weston Road, a major north-south artery in Toronto.  My confidence is high because the instructions involve simple directional changes and the distances are easily estimated based on my knowledge of Toronto's street grid in that area.  There are no complex intersections or unusual road layouts involved.  Close to this route are various residential and commercial buildings along Weston Road; specific POIs would depend on the precise location within the given coordinates.
