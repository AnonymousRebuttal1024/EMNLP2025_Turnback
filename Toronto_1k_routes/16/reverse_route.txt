**Confidence: 90%**

**Reason:** The route features clear directional changes and spans notable streets like Sutherland Drive and Parkhurst Boulevard, providing solid reference points for reversing directions confidently. Each action is logically inverted with attention to turns and slight adjustments. The confidence level is high, but slight uncertainty can exist due to urban environments where small detours or pathways might subtly alter expected travel patterns or where road conditions change. Thus, overall adherence to the sequence maintains expected path reverse accuracy.
