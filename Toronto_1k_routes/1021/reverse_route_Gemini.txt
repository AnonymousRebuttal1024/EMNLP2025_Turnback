Confidence: 85%

Reasoning:  This route appears to be in North York, possibly near Yonge Street and Sheppard Avenue, given the long initial eastbound leg and the coordinates. The 965.8 meters almost certainly represents a major east-west artery, likely Sheppard Avenue itself.  The subsequent turns and shorter segments suggest navigating smaller residential streets north of Sheppard.  I'm fairly confident in the initial westward direction and the reversal of the longer segment along Sheppard.  However, the numerous short segments and "slight" turns make precise reversal difficult without a visual map. The lack of street names also reduces my certainty.  Possible POIs near this route could include the Sheppard-Yonge subway station, shops and restaurants along Yonge Street, or parks in the North York area.
