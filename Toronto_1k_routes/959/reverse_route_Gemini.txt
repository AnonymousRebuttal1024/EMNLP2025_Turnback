Confidence: 70%

Reasoning: This route appears to start near Riverdale Park East and heads roughly southeast towards the Don Valley Parkway and the Queen Street Viaduct.  River Street, Oak Street, and the paths ("River Street Trail," "Downtown Downhill," "Riverdale Park Crossing") suggest movement through and around the park and down towards the Don Valley. The Bayview — Queen Path likely refers to a pedestrian or cycling path near the Don River. The many turns and changes between streets and paths decrease my confidence, especially without a visual map to confirm the exact locations of paths like "Downtown Downhill" and "Bayview — Queen Path." Landmarks would include Riverdale Park East, the Don Valley Parkway, and possibly the Queen Street Viaduct.
