Confidence: 90%

Reasoning: Canada's Walk of Fame offers a very strong landmark, placing the start of the route near King St W in the Entertainment District.  While the many turns after leaving this area make the exact path harder to visualize without a map, the presence of this landmark considerably boosts my confidence in the first part of the reversed directions. The turns suggest navigating smaller streets, possibly near or within the Entertainment District/Fashion District.  POIs besides the Walk of Fame itself could include theaters, restaurants, and shops, typical of the area.
