This is an extremely simple route going almost perfectly north.  Given the distance of 1650 meters and the starting coordinates, it's highly likely that this follows a major north-south arterial road, potentially Dufferin Street, Bathurst Street or Avenue Road as they align well with the location provided.  The reversal is trivial and highly likely to be accurate.  While I can't name specific landmarks without more information, there would undoubtedly be numerous businesses and intersections along such a long stretch of a major road.
