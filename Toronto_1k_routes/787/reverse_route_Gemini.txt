Confidence: 75%

This route is quite complex and seems to involve trails and park pathways, possibly near Edwards Gardens and the Don Valley, based on the coordinates and mentions of Wilket Creek Trail, Lawrence Walkway, Overland Trail and Barber Greene Road. The presence of these named paths helps significantly. However, the many turns and "keep left/right" instructions make it somewhat ambiguous. It's difficult to know the exact configuration of these paths and turns without being on the ground.  I'm reasonably confident in the main segments of the reversed route but less certain about some of the more minor turns.  Edwards Gardens, the Don Valley Ravine trails, and the Ontario Science Centre are possible POIs near this route.
